The estimation process usually is part of the backlog refinement meeting. Regarding the project circumstances we decided to estimate the user stories during the Sprint Planning. Starting the estimation process we noticed that we had to align our interpretation of the estimation effort as these story points are not equivalent to a certain time interval. The story points are relative values to compare the effort of the user stories. With this in mind we proceeded with the estimation of the user stories. We decided to start Sprint 1 with the following user stories and the total amount of 37 story points:\n&#x2022;\tICSDSHOW-2\tCreate invite for friends\t(8 Story Points)\n&#x2022;\tICSDSHOW-4\tCreate reservation\t\t(3)\n&#x2022;\tICSDSHOW-5\tHandle invite\t\t\t(3)\n&#x2022;\tICSDSHOW-6\tRevoke accepted invite \t(5)\n&#x2022;\tICSDSHOW-9\tCancel invite\t\t\t(3)\n&#x2022;\tICSDSHOW-11\tFilter menu\t\t\t(5)\n&#x2022;\tICSDSHOW-12\tDefine order\t\t\t(5)\n&#x2022;\tICSDSHOW-13\tOrder the order\t\t(5)\nAs the Sprint Planning is time boxed to one hour we managed to hold this meeting within this time window.\n"},{"id":2,"path":"../..\\..\\..\\..\\..\\xampp\\htdocs\\devonfw.github.io\\website\\pages\\docs/agile.asciidoc.html#agile.asciidoc_27.04.2017-sprint-1-review","type":"docs","title":"27.04.2017 Sprint 1 Review","body":"84.2. 27.04.2017 Sprint 1 Review\nDuring the Sprint 1 Review we had a discussion about the data model proposal. For the discussion we extended this particular Review meeting to 90min. As this discussion took almost 2/3 of the Review meeting we only had a short time left for our review of Sprint 1. For the following scrum events we decided to focus on the primary target of these events and have discussions needed for alignments in separate meetings.\nRegarding the topic of splitting user stories we had the example of a certain user story which included a functionality of a twitter integration (ICSDSHOW-17 User Profile and Twitter integration). As the twitter functionality could not have been implemented at this early point of time we thought about cutting the user story into two user stories. We aligned on mocking the twitter functionality until the dependencies are developed in order to test the components. As this user story is estimated with 13 story points it is a good example for the question whether to cut a user story into multiple user stories or not.\nUnfortunately not all user stories of Sprint 1 could have been completed. Due this situation we discussed on whether pushing all unfinished user stories into the status done or moving them to Sprint 2. We aligned on transferring the unfinished user stories into the next Sprint. During the Sprint 1 the team underestimated that a lot of holidays crossed the Sprint 1 goals. As taking holidays and absences of team members into consideration is part of a Sprint Planning we have a learning effect on setting a Sprint Scope.\n"},{"id":3,"path":"../..\\..\\..\\..\\..\\xampp\\htdocs\\devonfw.github.io\\website\\pages\\docs/agile.asciidoc.html#agile.asciidoc_03.05.2017-sprint-2-planning","type":"docs","title":"03.05.2017 Sprint 2 Planning","body":"84.3. 03.05.2017 Sprint 2 Planning\nAs we aligned during the Sprint 1 Review on transferring unfinished user stories into Sprint 2 the focus for Sprint 2 was on finishing these transferred user stories. During our discussion on how many user stories we could work on in Sprint 2 we needed to remind ourselves that the overall target is to develop an example application for the DevonFW. Considering this we aligned on a clear target for Sprint 2: To focus on finishing User Stories as we need to aim for a practicable and realizable solution. Everybody aligned on the aim of having a working application at the end of Sprint 2.\nFor the estimation process of user stories we make again usage of planningpoker.com as the team prefers this &#x201C;easy-to-use&#x201D; tool. During our second estimation process we had the situation in which the estimated story points differs strongly from one team member to another. In this case the team members shortly explains how the understood and interpreted the user story. It turned out that team members misinterpreted the user stories. With having this discussion all team members got the same understanding of the specific functionality and scope of a user story. After the alignment the team members adjusted their estimations.\nBeside this need for discussion the team estimated most of the user stories with very similar story points. This fact shows the increase within the effort estimation for each team member in comparison to Sprint 1 planning. Over the short time of two Sprint planning the team received a better understanding and feeling for the estimation with story points.\n"},{"id":4,"path":"../..\\..\\..\\..\\..\\xampp\\htdocs\\devonfw.github.io\\website\\pages\\docs/agile.asciidoc.html#agile.asciidoc_01.06.2017-sprint-2-review","type":"docs","title":"01.06.2017 Sprint 2 Review","body":"84.4. 01.06.2017 Sprint 2 Review\nAs our Sprint 1 Review four weeks ago was not completely structured like a Sprint Review meeting we focused on the actual intention of a Sprint Review meeting during Sprint 2 Review.

These dependencies need to be free of cycles. A business component exports its functionality via well-defined interfaces as a self-contained API. A business component may use another business component via its API and compliant with the dependencies defined by the business architecture.\nAs the business domain and logic of an application can be totally different, the devonfw can not define a standardized business architecture. Depending on the business domain it has to be defined from scratch or from a domain reference architecture template. For very small systems it may be suitable to define just a single business component containing all the code.\n"},{"id":34,"path":"../..\\..\\..\\..\\..\\xampp\\htdocs\\devonfw.github.io\\website\\pages\\docs/devon4j.asciidoc_architecture.html#architecture.asciidoc_technical-architecture","type":"docs","title":"Technical Architecture","body":"8.3.2. Technical Architecture\nThe technical architecture divides the application into technical layers based on the multilayered architecture. A layer is a unit of code with the same category such as a service or presentation logic. So, a layer is often supported by a technical framework. Each business component can therefore be split into component parts for each layer. However, a business component may not have component parts for every layer (e.g. only a presentation part that utilized logic from other components).\nAn overview of the technical reference architecture of the devonfw is given by figure &quot;Technical Reference Architecture&quot;.\nIt defines the following layers visualized as horizontal boxes:\nclient layer for the front-end (GUI).\nservice layer for the services used to expose functionality of the\nback-end to the client or other consumers.\nbatch layer for exposing functionality in batch-processes (e.g. mass imports).\nlogic layer for the business logic.\ndata-access layer for the data access (esp. persistence).\nAlso, you can see the (business) components as vertical boxes (e.g. A and X) and how they are composed out of component parts each one assigned to one of the technical layers.\nFurther, there are technical components for cross-cutting aspects grouped by the gray box on the left. Here is a complete list:\nSecurity\nLogging\nMonitoring\nTransaction-Handling\nException-Handling\nInternationalization\nDependency-Injection\nFigure 5. Technical Reference Architecture\nPlease click on the architecture image to open it as SVG and click on the layers and cross-cutting topics to open the according documentation guide.\nWe reflect this architecture in our code as described in our coding conventions allowing a traceability of business components, use-cases, layers, etc. into the code and giving\ndevelopers a sound orientation within the project.\nFurther, the architecture diagram shows the allowed dependencies illustrated by the dark green connectors.\nWithin a business component a component part can call the next component part on the layer directly below via a dependency on its API (vertical connectors).\nWhile this is natural and obvious, it is generally forbidden to have dependencies upwards the layers\nor to skip a layer by a direct dependency on a component part two or more layers below.\nThe general dependencies allowed between business components are defined by the business architecture.\nIn our reference architecture diagram we assume that the business component A1 is allowed to depend\non component A2. Therefore, a use-case within the logic component part of A1 is allowed to call a\nuse-case from A2 via a dependency on the component API. The same applies for dialogs on the client layer.\nThis is illustrated by the horizontal connectors. Please note that persistence entities are part of the API of the data-access component part so only the logic component part of the same\nbusiness component may depend on them.\nThe technical architecture has to address non-functional requirements:\nscalability\nis established by keeping state in the client and making the server state-less (except for login session). Via load-balancers new server nodes can be added to improve performance (horizontal scaling).\navailability and reliability\nare addressed by clustering with redundant nodes avoiding any single-point-of failure. If one node fails the system is still available. Further, the software has to be robust so there are no dead-locks or other bad effects that can make the system unavailable or not reliable.\nsecurity\nis archived in the devonfw by the right templates and best-practices that avoid vulnerabilities. See security guidelines for further details.\nperformance\nis obtained by choosing the right products and proper configurations. While the actual implementation of the application matters for performance a proper design is important as it is the key to allow performance-optimizations (see e.g. caching).\nTechnology Stack\nThe technology stack of the devonfw is illustrated by the following table.\nTable 25.

In other words only use Latin alpahnumeric ASCII characters with the common allowed technical separators for the accordign context (e.g. underscore) for technical names (even excluding whitespaces).\nFor package segments and type names prefer singular forms (CustomerEntity instead of CustomersEntity). Only use plural forms when there is no singular or it is really semantically required (e.g. for a container that contains multiple of such objects).\nAvoid having duplicate type names. The name of a class, interface, enum or annotation should be unique within your project unless this is intentionally desired in a special and reasonable situation.\nAvoid artificial naming constructs such as prefixes (I*) or suffixes (*IF) for interfaces.\nUse CamelCase even for abbreviations (XmlUtil instead of XMLUtil)\nAvoid property/field names where the second character is upper-case at all (e.g. &apos;aBc&apos;). See #1095 for details.\nNames of Generics should be easy to understand. Where suitable follow the common rule E=Element, T=Type, K=Key, V=Value but feel free to use longer names for more specific cases such as ID, DTO or ENTITY. The capitalized naming helps to distinguish a generic type from a regular class.\n"},{"id":42,"path":"../..\\..\\..\\..\\..\\xampp\\htdocs\\devonfw.github.io\\website\\pages\\docs/devon4j.asciidoc_coding-conventions.html#coding-conventions.asciidoc_packages","type":"docs","title":"Packages","body":"9.2. Packages\nJava Packages are the most important element to structure your code. We use a strict packaging convention to map technical layers and business components (slices) to the code (See technical architecture for further details). By using the same names in documentation and code we create a strong link that gives orientation and makes it easy to find from business requirements, specifications or story tickets into the code and back.\nFor an devon4j based application we use the following Java-Package schema:\n&#xAB;rootpackage&#xBB;.&#xAB;application&#xBB;.&#xAB;component&#xBB;.&#xAB;layer&#xBB;.&#xAB;scope&#xBB;[.&#xAB;detail&#xBB;]*\nE.g. in our example application we find the Spring Data repositories for the ordermanagement component in the package com.devonfw.application.mtsj.ordermanagement.dataaccess.api.repo\nTable 26.

Therefore, it is important to follow these rules:\nEach resource has to be closed properly, otherwise you will get out of file handles, TX sessions, memory leaks or the like\nWhere possible avoid to deal with such resources manually. That is why we are recommending @Transactional for transactions in devonfw (see Transaction Handling).\nIn case you have to deal with resources manually (e.g. binary streams) ensure to close them properly. See the example below for details.\nClosing streams and other such resources is error prone. Have a look at the following example:\n// bad\ntry {\nInputStream in = new FileInputStream(file);\nreadData(in);\nin.close();\n} catch (IOException e) {\nthrow new IllegalStateException(&quot;Failed to read data.&quot;, e);\n}\nThe code above is wrong as in case of an IOException the InputStream is not properly closed.

Lambdas and Streams\nWith Java8 you have cool new features like lambdas and monads like (Stream, CompletableFuture, Optional, etc.).\nHowever, these new features can also be misused or led to code that is hard to read or debug. To avoid pain, we give you the following best practices:\nLearn how to use the new features properly before using. Developers are often keen on using cool new features. When you do your first experiments in your project code you will cause deep pain and might be ashamed afterwards. Please study the features properly. Even Java8 experts still write for loops to iterate over collections, so only use these features where it really makes sense.\nStreams shall only be used in fluent API calls as a Stream can not be forked or reused.\nEach stream has to have exactly one terminal operation.\nDo not write multiple statements into lambda code:\n// bad\ncollection.stream().map(x -&gt; {\nFoo foo = doSomething(x);\n...\nreturn foo;\n}).collect(Collectors.toList());\nThis style makes the code hard to read and debug. Never do that! Instead, extract the lambda body to a private method with a meaningful name:\n// fine\ncollection.stream().map(this::convertToFoo).collect(Collectors.toList());\nDo not use parallelStream() in general code (that will run on server side) unless you know exactly what you are doing and what is going on under the hood. Some developers might think that using parallel streams is a good idea as it will make the code faster. However, if you want to do performance optimizations talk to your technical lead (architect). Many features such as security and transactions will rely on contextual information that is associated with the current thread. Hence, using parallel streams will most probably cause serious bugs. Only use them for standalone (CLI) applications or for code that is just processing large amounts of data.\nDo not perform operations on a sub-stream inside a lambda:\nset.stream().flatMap(x -&gt; x.getChildren().stream().filter(this::isSpecial)).collect(Collectors.toList()); // bad\nset.stream().flatMap(x -&gt; x.getChildren().stream()).filter(this::isSpecial).collect(Collectors.toList()); // fine\nOnly use collect at the end of the stream:\nset.stream().collect(Collectors.toList()).forEach(...) // bad\nset.stream().peek(...).collect(Collectors.toList()) // fine\nLambda parameters with Types inference\n(String a, Float b, Byte[] c) -&gt; a.toString() + Float.toString(b) + Arrays.toString(c) // bad\n(a,b,c) -&gt; a.toString() + Float.toString(b) + Arrays.toString(c) // fine\nCollections.sort(personList, (Person p1, Person p2) -&gt; p1.getSurName().compareTo(p2.getSurName())); // bad\nCollections.sort(personList, (p1, p2) -&gt; p1.getSurName().compareTo(p2.getSurName())); // fine\nAvoid Return Braces and Statement\na -&gt; { return a.toString(); } // bad\na -&gt; a.toString(); // fine\nAvoid Parentheses with Single Parameter\n(a) -&gt; a.toString(); // bad\na -&gt; a.toString(); // fine\nAvoid if/else inside foreach method.

Dependency Injection\nDependency injection is one of the most important design patterns and is a key principle to a modular and component based architecture. The Java Standard for dependency injection is javax.inject (JSR330) that we use in combination with JSR250.\nThere are many frameworks which support this standard including all recent Java EE application servers. We recommend to use Spring (also known as springframework) that we use in our example application. However, the modules we provide typically just rely on JSR330 and can be used with any compliant container.\n"},{"id":60,"path":"../..\\..\\..\\..\\..\\xampp\\htdocs\\devonfw.github.io\\website\\pages\\docs/devon4j.asciidoc_guides.html#guide-dependency-injection.asciidoc_key-principles","type":"docs","title":"Key Principles","body":"12.1.1. Key Principles\nA Bean in CDI (Contexts and Dependency-Injection) or Spring is typically part of a larger component and encapsulates some piece of logic that should in general be replaceable. As an example we can think of a Use-Case, Data-Access-Object (DAO), etc. As best practice we use the following principles:\nSeparation of API and implementation\nWe create a self-contained API documented with JavaDoc. Then we create an implementation of this API that we annotate with @Named. This implementation is treated as secret. Code from other components that wants to use the implementation shall only rely on the API. Therefore we use dependency injection via the interface with the @Inject annotation.\nStateless implementation\nBy default implementations (CDI-Beans) shall always be stateless. If you store state information in member variables you can easily run into concurrency problems and nasty bugs. This is easy to avoid by using local variables and separate state classes for complex state-information. Try to avoid stateful CDI-Beans wherever possible. Only add state if you are fully aware of what you are doing and properly document this as a warning in your JavaDoc.\nUsage of JSR330\nWe use javax.inject (JSR330) and JSR250 as a common standard that makes our code portable (works in any modern Java EE environment). However, we recommend to use the springframework as container. But we never use proprietary annotations such as @Autowired instead of standardized annotations like @Inject. Generally we avoid proprietary annotations in business code (common and logic layer).\nSimple Injection-Style\nIn general you can choose between constructor, setter or field injection. For simplicity we recommend to do private field injection as it is very compact and easy to maintain. We believe that constructor injection is bad for maintenance especially in case of inheritance (if you change the dependencies you need to refactor all sub-classes). Private field injection and public setter injection are very similar but setter injection is much more verbose (often you are even forced to have javadoc for all public methods). If you are writing re-usable library code setter injection will make sense as it is more flexible. In a business application you typically do not need that and can save a lot of boiler-plate code if you use private field injection instead. Nowadays you are using container infrastructure also for your tests (see spring integration tests) so there is no need to inject manually (what would require a public setter).\nKISS\nTo follow the KISS (keep it small and simple) principle we avoid advanced features (e.g. AOP, non-singleton beans) and only use them where necessary.\n"},{"id":61,"path":"../..\\..\\..\\..\\..\\xampp\\htdocs\\devonfw.github.io\\website\\pages\\docs/devon4j.asciidoc_guides.html#guide-dependency-injection.asciidoc_example-bean","type":"docs","title":"Example Bean","body":"12.1.2. Example Bean\nHere you can see the implementation of an example bean using JSR330 and JSR250:\n@Named\npublic class MyBeanImpl implements MyBean {\n@Inject\nprivate MyOtherBean myOtherBean;\n@PostConstruct\npublic void init() {\n// initialization if required (otherwise omit this method)\n}\n@PreDestroy\npublic void dispose() {\n// shutdown bean, free resources if required (otherwise omit this method)\n}\n}\nIt depends on MyOtherBean that should be the interface of an other component that is injected into the field because of the @Inject annotation. To make this work there must be exactly one implementation of MyOtherBean in the container (in our case spring). In order to put a Bean into the container we use the @Named annotation so in our example we put MyBeanImpl into the container. Therefore it can be injected into all setters that take the interface MyBean as argument and are annotated with @Inject.\nIn some situations you may have an Interface that defines a kind of &quot;plugin&quot; where you can have multiple implementations in your container and want to have all of them. Then you can request a list with all instances of that interface as in the following example:\n@Inject\nprivate List&lt;MyConverter&gt; converters;\nPlease note that when writing library code instead of annotating implementation with @Named it is better to provide @Configuration classes that choose the implementation via @Bean methods (see @Bean documentation).

Using Spring Boot (must read: Spring Boot reference) we rely on a comprehensive configuration approach following a &quot;convention over configuration&quot; pattern. This guide adds on to this by detailed instructions and best-practices how to deal with configurations.\nIn general we distinguish the following kinds of configuration that are explained in the following sections:\nInternal Application configuration maintained by developers\nExternalized Environment configuration maintained by operators\nExternalized Business configuration maintained by business administrators\n"},{"id":64,"path":"../..\\..\\..\\..\\..\\xampp\\htdocs\\devonfw.github.io\\website\\pages\\docs/devon4j.asciidoc_guides.html#guide-configuration.asciidoc_internal-application-configuration","type":"docs","title":"Internal Application Configuration","body":"12.2.1. Internal Application Configuration\nThe application configuration contains all internal settings and wirings of the application (bean wiring, database mappings, etc.) and is maintained by the application developers at development time. There usually is a main configuration registered with main Spring Boot App, but differing configurations to support automated test of the application can be defined using profiles (not detailed in this guide).\nSpring Boot Application\nThe devonfw recommends using spring-boot to build web applications.\nFor a complete documentation see the Spring Boot Reference Guide.\nWith spring-boot you provide a simple main class (also called starter class) like this:\ncom.devonfw.mtsj.application\n@SpringBootApplication(exclude = { EndpointAutoConfiguration.class })\n@EntityScan(basePackages = { &quot;com.devonfw.mtsj.application&quot; }, basePackageClasses = { AdvancedRevisionEntity.class })\n@EnableGlobalMethodSecurity(jsr250Enabled = true)\n@ComponentScan(basePackages = { &quot;com.devonfw.mtsj.application.general&quot;, &quot;com.devonfw.mtsj.application&quot; })\npublic class SpringBootApp {\n/**\n* Entry point for spring-boot based app\n*\n* @param args - arguments\n*/\npublic static void main(String[] args) {\nSpringApplication.run(SpringBootApp.class, args);\n}\n}\nIn an devonfw application this main class is always located in the &lt;basepackage&gt; of the application package namespace (see package-conventions). This is because a spring boot application will automatically do a classpath scan for components (spring-beans) and entities in the package where the application main class is located including all sub-packages. You can use the @ComponentScan and @EntityScan annotations to customize this behaviour.\nIf you want to map spring configuration properties into your custom code please see configuration mapping.\nStandard beans configuration\nFor basic bean configuration we rely on spring boot using mainly configuration classes and only occasionally XML configuration files. Some key principle to understand Spring Boot auto-configuration features:\nSpring Boot auto-configuration attempts to automatically configure your Spring application based on the jar dependencies and annotated components found in your source code.\nAuto-configuration is non-invasive, at any point you can start to define your own configuration to replace specific parts of the auto-configuration by redefining your identically named bean (see also exclude attribute of @SpringBootApplication in example code above).\nBeans are configured via annotations in your java code (see dependency-injection).\nFor technical configuration you will typically write additional spring config classes annotated with @Configuration that provide bean implementations via methods annotated with @Bean. See spring @Bean documentation for further details. Like in XML you can also use @Import to make a @Configuration class include other configurations.\nMore specific configuration files (as required) reside in an adequately named subfolder of:\nsrc/main/resources/app\nBeanMapper Configuration\nIn case you are still using dozer, you will find further details in bean-mapper configuration.\nSecurity configuration\nThe abstract base class BaseWebSecurityConfig should be extended to configure web application security thoroughly.\nA basic and secure configuration is provided which can be overridden or extended by subclasses.\nSubclasses must use the @Profile annotation to further discriminate between beans used in production and testing scenarios. See the following example:\nListing 7. How to extend BaseWebSecurityConfig for Production and Test\n@Configuration\n@EnableWebSecurity\n@Profile(SpringProfileConstants.JUNIT)\npublic class TestWebSecurityConfig extends BaseWebSecurityConfig {...}\n@Configuration\n@EnableWebSecurity\n@Profile(SpringProfileConstants.NOT_JUNIT)\npublic class WebSecurityConfig extends BaseWebSecurityConfig {...}\nSee WebSecurityConfig.\nWebSocket configuration\nA websocket endpoint is configured within the business package as a Spring configuration class. The annotation @EnableWebSocketMessageBroker makes Spring Boot registering this endpoint.\npackage your.path.to.the.websocket.config;\n...\n@Configuration\n@EnableWebSocketMessageBroker\npublic class WebSocketConfig extends AbstractWebSocketMessageBrokerConfigurer {\n...\nDatabase Configuration\nTo choose database of your choice , set spring.profiles.active=XXX in src/main/resources/config/application.properties.

Externalized Configuration\nExternalized configuration is a configuration that is provided separately to a deployment package and can be maintained undisturbed by re-deployments.\nEnvironment Configuration\nThe environment configuration contains configuration parameters (typically port numbers, host names, passwords, logins, timeouts, certificates, etc.) specific for the different environments. These are under the control of the operators responsible for the application.\nThe environment configuration is maintained in application.properties files, defining various properties (see common application properties for a list of properties defined by the spring framework).\nThese properties are explained in the corresponding configuration sections of the guides for each topic:\npersistence configuration\nservice configuration\nlogging guide\nFor a general understanding how spring-boot is loading and boostrapping your application.properties see spring-boot external configuration.\nThe following properties files are used in every devonfw application:\nsrc/main/resources/application.properties providing a default configuration - bundled and deployed with the application package. It further acts as a template to derive a tailored minimal environment-specific configuration.\nsrc/main/resources/config/application.properties providing additional properties only used at development time (for all local deployment scenarios). This property file is excluded from all packaging.\nsrc/test/resources/config/application.properties providing additional properties only used for testing (JUnits based on spring test).\nFor other environments where the software gets deployed such as test, acceptance and production you need to provide a tailored copy of application.properties. The location depends on the deployment strategy:\nstandalone run-able Spring Boot App using embedded tomcat: config/application.properties under the installation directory of the spring boot application.\ndedicated tomcat (one tomcat per app): $CATALINA_BASE/lib/config/application.properties\ntomcat serving a number of apps (requires expanding the wars): $CATALINA_BASE/webapps/&lt;app&gt;/WEB-INF/classes/config\nIn this application.properties you only define the minimum properties that are environment specific and inherit everything else from the bundled src/main/resources/application.properties. In any case, make very sure that the classloader will find the file.\nMake sure your properties are thoroughly documented by providing a comment to each property. This inline documentation is most valuable for your operating department.\nBusiness Configuration\nOften applications do not need business configuration. In case they do it should typically be editable by administrators via the GUI. The business configuration values should therefore be stored in the database in key/value pairs.\nTherefore we suggest to create a dedicated table with (at least) the following columns:\nID\nProperty name\nProperty type (Boolean, Integer, String)\nProperty value\nDescription\nAccording to the entries in this table, an administrative GUI may show a generic form to modify business configuration. Boolean values should be shown as checkboxes, integer and string values as text fields. The values should be validated according to their type so an error is raised if you try to save a string in an integer property for example.\nWe recommend the following base layout for the hierarchical business configuration:\ncomponent.[subcomponent].[subcomponent].propertyname\n"},{"id":66,"path":"../..\\..\\..\\..\\..\\xampp\\htdocs\\devonfw.github.io\\website\\pages\\docs/devon4j.asciidoc_guides.html#guide-configuration.asciidoc_security","type":"docs","title":"Security","body":"12.2.3. Security\nOften you need to have passwords (for databases, third-party services, etc.) as part of your configuration. These are typically environment specific (see above). However, with DevOps and continuous-deployment you might be tempted to commit such configurations into your version-control (e.g. git). Doing that with plain text passwords is a severe problem especially for production systems. Never do that! Instead we offer some suggestions how to deal with sensible configurations:\nPassword Encryption\nA simple but reasonable approach is to configure the passwords encrypted with a master-password. The master-password should be a strong secret that is specific for each environment. It must never be committed to version-control.\nIn order to support encrypted passwords in spring-boot application.properties all you need to do is to add jasypt-spring-boot as dependency in your pom.xml (please check for recent version here):\n&lt;dependency&gt;\n&lt;groupId&gt;com.github.ulisesbocchio&lt;/groupId&gt;\n&lt;artifactId&gt;jasypt-spring-boot-starter&lt;/artifactId&gt;\n&lt;version&gt;3.0.3&lt;/version&gt;\n&lt;/dependency&gt;\nThis will smoothly integrate jasypt into your spring-boot application. Read this HOWTO to learn how to encrypt and decrypt passwords using jasypt.\nNext, we give a simple example how to encypt and configure a secret value.\nWe use the algorithm PBEWITHHMACSHA512ANDAES_256 that provides strong encryption and is the default of jasypt-spring-boot-starter.\nHowever, different algorithms can be used if perferred (e.g. PBEWITHMD5ANDTRIPLEDES).\njava -cp ${M2_REPO}/org/jasypt/jasypt/1.9.3/jasypt-1.9.3.jar org.jasypt.intf.cli.JasyptPBEStringEncryptionCLI password=masterpassword algorithm=PBEWITHHMACSHA512ANDAES_256 input=secret ivGeneratorClassName=org.jasypt.iv.RandomIvGenerator\n----ENVIRONMENT-----------------\nRuntime: AdoptOpenJDK OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM 11.0.5+10\n----ARGUMENTS-------------------\ninput: secret\npassword: masterpassword\nivGeneratorClassName: org.jasypt.iv.RandomIvGenerator\nalgorithm: PBEWITHHMACSHA512ANDAES_256\n----OUTPUT----------------------\nPoUxkNjY2juQMCyPu6ic5KJy1XfK+bX9vu2/mPj3pmcO4iydG6mhgZRZSw50z/oC\nOf course the master-password (masterpassword) and the actual password to encrypt (secret) are just examples.\nPlease replace them with reasonable strong passwords for your environment.\nFurther, if you are using devonfw-ide you can make your life much easier and just type:\ndevon jasypt encrypt\nSee jasypt commandlet for details.\nNow the entire line after the OUTPUT block is your encrypted secret.\nIt even contains some random salt so that multiple encryption invocations with the same parameters (ARGUMENTS) will produce a different OUTPUT.\nThe master-password can be configured on your target environment via the property jasypt.encryptor.password. As system properties given on the command-line are visible in the process list, we recommend to use an config/application.yml file only for this purpose (as we recommended to use application.properties for regular configs):\njasypt:\nencryptor:\npassword: masterpassword\nAgain masterpassword is just an example that your replace with your actual master password.\nNow you are able to put encrypted passwords into your application.properties and specify the algorithm.\nspring.datasource.password=ENC(PoUxkNjY2juQMCyPu6ic5KJy1XfK+bX9vu2/mPj3pmcO4iydG6mhgZRZSw50z/oC)\njasypt.encryptor.algorithm=PBEWITHHMACSHA512ANDAES_256\nThis application.properties file can be version controlled (git-opts) and without knowing the masterpassword nobody is able to decrypt this to get the actual secret back.\nTo prevent jasypt to throw an exception in dev or test scenarios you can simply put this in your local config (src/main/config/application.properties and same for test, see above for details):\njasypt.encryptor.password=none\nIs this Security by Obscurity?\nYes, from the point of view to protect the passwords on the target environment this is nothing but security by obscurity. If an attacker somehow got full access to the machine this will only cause him to spend some more time.\nNo, if someone only gets the configuration file. So all your developers might have access to the version-control where the config is stored. Others might have access to the software releases that include this configs.

So never have something like foo.bar=value and foo.bar.child=value2.\nstart with a segment namespace unique to your context or application\na good example would be &#xAB;myapp&#xBB;.billing.service.email.sender for the sender address of billing service emails send by &#xAB;myapp&#xBB;.\nMapping advanced configuration\nHowever, in many scenarios you will have features that require more than just one property.\nInjecting those via @Value is not leading to good code quality.\nInstead we create a class with the suffix ConfigProperties containing all configuration properties for our aspect that is annotated with @ConfigurationProperties:\n@ConfigurationProperties(prefix = &quot;myapp.billing.service&quot;)\npublic class BillingServiceConfigProperties {\nprivate final Email email = new Email();\nprivate final Smtp smtp = new Smtp();\npublic Email getEmail() { return this.email; }\npublic Email getSmtp() { return this.smtp; }\npublic static class Email {\nprivate String sender;\nprivate String subject;\npublic String getSender() { return this.sender; }\npublic void setSender(String sender) { this.sender = sender; }\npublic String getSubject() { return this.subject; }\npublic void setSubject(String subject) { this.subject = subject; }\n}\npublic static class Smtp {\nprivate String host;\nprivate int port = 25;\npublic String getHost() { return this.host; }\npublic void setHost(String host) { this.host = host; }\npublic int getPort() { return this.port; }\npublic void setPort(int port) { this.port = port; }\n}\n}\nOf course this is just an example to demonstrate this feature of spring-boot.\nIn order to send emails you would typically use the existing spring-email feature.\nBut as you can see this allows us to define and access our configuration in a very structured and comfortable way.\nThe annotation @ConfigurationProperties(prefix = &quot;myapp.billing.service&quot;) will automatically map spring configuration properties starting with myapp.billing.service via the according getters and setters into our BillingServiceConfigProperties.\nWe can easily define defaults (e.g. 25 as default value for myapp.billing.service.smtp.port).\nAlso Email or Smtp could be top-level classes to be reused in multiple configurations.\nOf course you would also add helpful JavaDoc comments to the getters and classes to document your configuration options.\nFurther to access this configuration, we can use standard dependency-injection:\n@Inject\nprivate BillingServiceConfigProperties config;\nFor very generic cases you may also use Map&lt;String, String&gt; to map any kind of property in an untyped way.\nAn example for generic configuration from devon4j can be found in\nServiceConfigProperties.\nFor further details about this feature also consult Guide to @ConfigurationProperties in Spring Boot.\nGenerate configuration metadata\nYou should further add this dependency to your module containing the *ConfigProperties:\n&lt;dependency&gt;\n&lt;groupId&gt;org.springframework.boot&lt;/groupId&gt;\n&lt;artifactId&gt;spring-boot-configuration-processor&lt;/artifactId&gt;\n&lt;optional&gt;true&lt;/optional&gt;\n&lt;/dependency&gt;\nThis will generate configuration metadata so projects using your code can benefit from autocompletion and getting your JavaDoc as tooltip when editing application.properites what makes this approach very powerful.\nFor further details about this please read A Guide to Spring Boot Configuration Metadata.\n"},{"id":68,"path":"../..\\..\\..\\..\\..\\xampp\\htdocs\\devonfw.github.io\\website\\pages\\docs/devon4j.asciidoc_guides.html#guide-jpa.asciidoc","type":"docs","title":"Java Persistence API","body":"12.3.

Entity\nEntities are part of the persistence layer and contain the actual data. They are POJOs (Plain Old Java Objects) on which the relational data of a database is mapped and vice versa. The mapping is configured via JPA annotations (javax.persistence). Usually an entity class corresponds to a table of a database and a property to a column of that table. A persistent entity instance then represents a row of the database table.\nA Simple Entity\nThe following listing shows a simple example:\n@Entity\n@Table(name=&quot;TEXTMESSAGE&quot;)\npublic class MessageEntity extends ApplicationPersistenceEntity implements Message {\nprivate String text;\npublic String getText() {\nreturn this.text;\n}\npublic void setText(String text) {\nthis.text = text;\n}\n}\nThe @Entity annotation defines that instances of this class will be entities which can be stored in the database. The @Table annotation is optional and can be used to define the name of the corresponding table in the database. If it is not specified, the simple name of the entity class is used instead.\nIn order to specify how to map the attributes to columns we annotate the corresponding getter methods (technically also private field annotation is also possible but approaches can not be mixed).\nThe @Id annotation specifies that a property should be used as primary key.\nWith the help of the @Column annotation it is possible to define the name of the column that an attribute is mapped to as well as other aspects such as nullable or unique. If no column name is specified, the name of the property is used as default.\nNote that every entity class needs a constructor with public or protected visibility that does not have any arguments. Moreover, neither the class nor its getters and setters may be final.\nEntities should be simple POJOs and not contain business logic.\nEntities and Datatypes\nStandard datatypes like Integer, BigDecimal, String, etc. are mapped automatically by JPA. Custom datatypes are mapped as serialized BLOB by default what is typically undesired.\nIn order to map atomic custom datatypes (implementations of`+SimpleDatatype`) we implement an AttributeConverter. ere is a simple example:\n@Converter(autoApply = true)\npublic class MoneyAttributeConverter implements AttributeConverter&lt;Money, BigDecimal&gt; {\npublic BigDecimal convertToDatabaseColumn(Money attribute) {\nreturn attribute.getValue();\n}\npublic Money convertToEntityAttribute(BigDecimal dbData) {\nreturn new Money(dbData);\n}\n}\nThe annotation @Converter is detected by the JPA vendor if the annotated class is in the packages to scan. Further, autoApply = true implies that the converter is automatically used for all properties of the handled datatype. Therefore all entities with properties of that datatype will automatically be mapped properly (in our example Money is mapped as BigDecimal).\nIn case you have a composite datatype that you need to map to multiple columns the JPA does not offer a real solution. As a workaround you can use a bean instead of a real datatype and declare it as @Embeddable. If you are using hibernate you can implement CompositeUserType. Via the @TypeDef annotation it can be registered to hibernate. If you want to annotate the CompositeUserType implementation itself you also need another annotation (e.g. MappedSuperclass tough not technically correct) so it is found by the scan.\nEnumerations\nBy default JPA maps Enums via their ordinal. Therefore the database will only contain the ordinals (0, 1, 2, etc.) . So , inside the database you can not easily understand their meaning. Using @Enumerated with EnumType.STRING allows to map the enum values to their name (Enum.name()). Both approaches are fragile when it comes to code changes and refactoring (if you change the order of the enum values or rename them) after the application is deployed to production. If you want to avoid this and get a robust mapping you can define a dedicated string in each enum value for database representation that you keep untouched. Then you treat the enum just like any other custom datatype.\nBLOB\nIf binary or character large objects (BLOB/CLOB) should be used to store the value of an attribute, e.g. to store an icon, the @Lob annotation should be used as shown in the following listing:\n@Lob\npublic byte[] getIcon() {\nreturn this.icon;\n}\nWarning\nUsing a byte array will cause problems if BLOBs get large because the entire BLOB is loaded into the RAM of the server and has to be processed by the garbage collector. For larger BLOBs the type Blob and streaming should be used.\npublic Blob getAttachment() {\nreturn this.attachment;\n}\nDate and Time\nTo store date and time related values, the temporal annotation can be used as shown in the listing below:\n@Temporal(TemporalType.TIMESTAMP)\npublic java.util.Date getStart() {\nreturn start;\n}\nUntil Java8 the java data type java.util.Date (or Jodatime) has to be used.\nTemporalType defines the granularity. In this case, a precision of nanoseconds is used. If this granularity is not wanted, TemporalType.DATE can be used instead, which only has a granularity of milliseconds.\nMixing these two granularities can cause problems when comparing one value to another. This is why we only use TemporalType.TIMESTAMP.\nQueryDSL and Custom Types\nUsing the Aliases API of QueryDSL might result in an InvalidDataAccessApiUsageException when using custom datatypes in entity properties. This can be circumvented in two steps:\nEnsure you have the following maven dependencies in your project (core module) to support custom types via the Aliases API:\n&lt;dependency&gt;\n&lt;groupId&gt;org.ow2.asm&lt;/groupId&gt;\n&lt;artifactId&gt;asm&lt;/artifactId&gt;\n&lt;/dependency&gt;\n&lt;dependency&gt;\n&lt;groupId&gt;cglib&lt;/groupId&gt;\n&lt;artifactId&gt;cglib&lt;/artifactId&gt;\n&lt;/dependency&gt;\nMake sure, that all your custom types used in entities provide a non-argument constructor with at least visibility level protected.\nIdRef\nIdRef can be used to reference the other entities in TOs\nIdRef is just a wrapper for reference ID as Long. so instead of\nprivate Long orderId;\nyou can write\nprivate IdRef&lt;Order&gt; orderId;\nWhen using IdRef make sure that the Junit tests contains the following\nJunit test should be derived from DbTest (e.g. ComponentDbTest and SubsystemDbTest).\nPrimary Keys\nWe only use simple Long values as primary keys (IDs). By default it is auto generated (@GeneratedValue(strategy=GenerationType.AUTO)). This is already provided by the class com.devonfw.&lt;projectName&gt;.general.dataaccess.api.AbstractPersistenceEntity that you can extend.\nIn case you have business oriented keys (often as String), you can define an additional property for it and declare it as unique (@Column(unique=true)).\nBe sure to include &quot;AUTO_INCREMENT&quot; in your sql table field ID to be able to persist data (or similar for other databases).\n"},{"id":70,"path":"../..\\..\\..\\..\\..\\xampp\\htdocs\\devonfw.github.io\\website\\pages\\docs/devon4j.asciidoc_guides.html#guide-jpa.asciidoc_relationships","type":"docs","title":"Relationships","body":"12.3.2. Relationships\nn:1 and 1:1 Relationships\nEntities often do not exist independently but are in some relation to each other. For example, for every period of time one of the StaffMember&#x2019;s of the restaurant example has worked, which is represented by the class WorkingTime, there is a relationship to this StaffMember.\nThe following listing shows how this can be modeled using JPA:\n...\n@Entity\npublic class WorkingTimeEntity {\n...\nprivate StaffMemberEntity staffMember;\n@ManyToOne\n@JoinColumn(name=&quot;STAFFMEMBER&quot;)\npublic StaffMemberEntity getStaffMember() {\nreturn this.staffMember;\n}\npublic void setStaffMember(StaffMemberEntity staffMember) {\nthis.staffMember = staffMember;\n}\n}\nTo represent the relationship, an attribute of the type of the corresponding entity class that is referenced has been introduced. The relationship is a n:1 relationship, because every WorkingTime belongs to exactly one StaffMember, but a StaffMember usually worked more often than once.\nThis is why the @ManyToOne annotation is used here. For 1:1 relationships the @OneToOne annotation can be used which works basically the same way. To be able to save information about the relation in the database, an additional column in the corresponding table of WorkingTime is needed which contains the primary key of the referenced StaffMember. With the name element of the @JoinColumn annotation it is possible to specify the name of this column.\n1:n and n:m Relationships\nThe relationship of the example listed above is currently an unidirectional one, as there is a getter method for retrieving the StaffMember from the WorkingTime object, but not vice versa.\nTo make it a bidirectional one, the following code has to be added to StaffMember:\nprivate Set&lt;WorkingTimeEntity&gt; workingTimes;\n@OneToMany(mappedBy=&quot;staffMember&quot;)\npublic Set&lt;WorkingTimeEntity&gt; getWorkingTimes() {\nreturn this.workingTimes;\n}\npublic void setWorkingTimes(Set&lt;WorkingTimeEntity&gt; workingTimes) {\nthis.workingTimes = workingTimes;\n}\nTo make the relationship bidirectional, the tables in the database do not have to be changed. Instead the column that corresponds to the attribute staffMember in class WorkingTime is used, which is specified by the mappedBy element of the @OneToMany annotation. Hibernate will search for corresponding WorkingTime objects automatically when a StaffMember is loaded.\nThe problem with bidirectional relationships is that if a WorkingTime object is added to the set or list workingTimes in StaffMember, this does not have any effect in the database unless\nthe staffMember attribute of that WorkingTime object is set. That is why the devon4j advices not to use bidirectional relationships but to use queries instead. How to do this is shown here. If a bidirectional relationship should be used nevertheless, appropriate add and remove methods must be used.\nFor 1:n and n:m relations, the devon4j demands that (unordered) Sets and no other collection types are used, as shown in the listing above. The only exception is whenever an ordering is really needed, (sorted) lists can be used.\nFor example, if WorkingTime objects should be sorted by their start time, this could be done like this:\nprivate List&lt;WorkingTimeEntity&gt; workingTimes;\n@OneToMany(mappedBy = &quot;staffMember&quot;)\n@OrderBy(&quot;startTime asc&quot;)\npublic List&lt;WorkingTimeEntity&gt; getWorkingTimes() {\nreturn this.workingTimes;\n}\npublic void setWorkingTimes(List&lt;WorkingTimeEntity&gt; workingTimes) {\nthis.workingTimes = workingTimes;\n}\nThe value of the @OrderBy annotation consists of an attribute name of the class followed by asc (ascending) or desc (descending).\nTo store information about a n:m relationship, a separate table has to be used, as one column cannot store several values (at least if the database schema is in first normal form).\nFor example if one wanted to extend the example application so that all ingredients of one FoodDrink can be saved and to model the ingredients themselves as entities (e.g. to store additional information about them), this could be modeled as follows (extract of class FoodDrink):\nprivate Set&lt;IngredientEntity&gt; ingredients;\n@ManyToMany()\n@JoinTable\npublic Set&lt;IngredientEntity&gt; getIngredients() {\nreturn this.ingredients;\n}\npublic void setOrders(Set&lt;IngredientEntity&gt; ingredients) {\nthis.ingredients = ingredients;\n}\nInformation about the relation is stored in a table called BILL_ORDER that has to have two columns, one for referencing the Bill, the other one for referencing the Order. Note that the @JoinTable annotation is not needed in this case because a separate table is the default solution here (same for n:m relations) unless there is a mappedBy element specified.\nFor 1:n relationships this solution has the disadvantage that more joins (in the database system) are needed to get a Bill with all the Orders it refers to. This might have a negative impact on performance so that the solution to store a reference to the Bill row/entity in the Order&#x2019;s table is probably the better solution in most cases.\nNote that bidirectional n:m relationships are not allowed for applications based on devon4j. Instead a third entity has to be introduced, which &quot;represents&quot; the relationship (it has two n:1 relationships).\nEager vs. Lazy Loading\nUsing JPA it is possible to use either lazy or eager loading. Eager loading means that for entities retrieved from the database, other entities that are referenced by these entities are also retrieved, whereas lazy loading means that this is only done when they are actually needed, i.e. when the corresponding getter method is invoked.\nApplication based on devon4j are strongly advised to always use lazy loading. The JPA defaults are:\n@OneToMany: LAZY\n@ManyToMany: LAZY\n@ManyToOne: EAGER\n@OneToOne: EAGER\nSo at least for @ManyToOne and @OneToOne you always need to override the default by providing fetch = FetchType.LAZY.\nImportant\nPlease read the performance guide.\nCascading Relationships\nFor relations it is also possible to define whether operations are cascaded (like a recursion) to the related entity.\nBy default, nothing is done in these situations. This can be changed by using the cascade property of the annotation that specifies the relation type (@OneToOne, @ManyToOne, @OneToMany, @ManyToOne). This property accepts a CascadeType that offers the following options:\nPERSIST (for EntityManager.persist, relevant to inserted transient entities into DB)\nREMOVE (for EntityManager.remove to delete entity from DB)\nMERGE (for EntityManager.merge)\nREFRESH (for EntityManager.refresh)\nDETACH (for EntityManager.detach)\nALL (cascade all of the above operations)\nSee here for more information.\n"},{"id":71,"path":"../..\\..\\..\\..\\..\\xampp\\htdocs\\devonfw.github.io\\website\\pages\\docs/devon4j.asciidoc_guides.html#guide-jpa.asciidoc_embeddable","type":"docs","title":"Embeddable","body":"12.3.3. Embeddable\nAn embeddable Object is a way to group properties of an entity into a separate Java (child) object. Unlike with implement relationships the embeddable is not a separate entity and its properties are stored (embedded) in the same table together with the entity. This is helpful to structure and reuse groups of properties.\nThe following example shows an Address implemented as an embeddable class:\n@Embeddable\npublic class AddressEmbeddable {\nprivate String street;\nprivate String number;\nprivate Integer zipCode;\nprivate String city;\n@Column(name=&quot;STREETNUMBER&quot;)\npublic String getNumber() {\nreturn number;\n}\npublic void setNumber(String number) {\nthis.number = number;\n}\n... // other getter and setter methods, equals, hashCode\n}\nAs you can see an embeddable is similar to an entity class, but with an @Embeddable annotation instead of the @Entity annotation and without primary key or modification counter.\nAn Embeddable does not exist on its own but in the context of an entity.\nAs a simplification Embeddables do not require a separate interface and ETO as the bean-mapper will create a copy automatically when converting the owning entity to an ETO.\nHowever, in this case the embeddable becomes part of your api module that therefore needs a dependency on the JPA.\nIn addition to that the methods equals(Object) and hashCode() need to be implemented as this is required by Hibernate (it is not required for entities because they can be unambiguously identified by their primary key). For some hints on how to implement the hashCode() method please have a look here.\nUsing this AddressEmbeddable inside an entity class can be done like this:\nprivate AddressEmbeddable address;\n@Embedded\npublic AddressEmbeddable getAddress() {\nreturn this.address;\n}\npublic void setAddress(AddressEmbeddable address) {\nthis.address = address;\n}\n}\nThe @Embedded annotation needs to be used for embedded attributes. Note that if in all columns of the embeddable (here Address) are null, then the embeddable object itself is also null inside the entity. This has to be considered to avoid NullPointerException&#x2019;s. Further this causes some issues with primitive types in embeddable classes that can be avoided by only using object types instead.\n"},{"id":72,"path":"../..\\..\\..\\..\\..\\xampp\\htdocs\\devonfw.github.io\\website\\pages\\docs/devon4j.asciidoc_guides.html#guide-jpa.asciidoc_inheritance","type":"docs","title":"Inheritance","body":"12.3.4. Inheritance\nJust like normal java classes, entity classes can inherit from others. The only difference is that you need to specify how to map a class hierarchy to database tables. Generic abstract super-classes for entities can simply be annotated with @MappedSuperclass.\nFor all other cases the JPA offers the annotation @Inheritance with the property strategy talking an InheritanceType that has the following options:\nSINGLE_TABLE: This strategy uses a single table that contains all columns needed to store all entity-types of the entire inheritance hierarchy. If a column is not needed for an entity because of its type, there is a null value in this column. An additional column is introduced, which denotes the type of the entity (called dtype).\nTABLE_PER_CLASS: For each concrete entity class there is a table in the database that can store such an entity with all its attributes. An entity is only saved in the table corresponding to its most concrete type. To get all entities of a super type, joins are needed.\nJOINED: In this case there is a table for every entity class including abstract classes, which contains only the columns for the persistent properties of that particular class. Additionally there is a primary key column in every table. To get an entity of a class that is a subclass of another one, joins are needed.\nEach of the three approaches has its advantages and drawbacks, which are discussed in detail here. In most cases, the first one should be used, because it is usually the fastest way to do the mapping, as no joins are needed when retrieving, searching or persisting entities. Moreover it is rather simple and easy to understand.\nOne major disadvantage is that the first approach could lead to a table with a lot of null values, which might have a negative impact on the database size.\nThe inheritance strategy has to be annotated to the top-most entity of the class hierarchy (where `@MappedSuperclass`es are not considered) like in the following example:\n@Entity\n@Inheritance(strategy=InheritanceType.SINGLE_TABLE)\npublic abstract class MyParentEntity extends ApplicationPersistenceEntity implements MyParent {\n...\n}\n@Entity\npublic class MyChildEntity extends MyParentEntity implements MyChild {\n...\n}\n@Entity\npublic class MyOtherEntity extends MyParentEntity implements MyChild {\n...\n}\nAs a best practice we advise you to avoid entity hierarchies at all where possible and otherwise to keep the hierarchy as small as possible. In order to just ensure reuse or establish a common API you can consider a shared interface, a @MappedSuperclass or an @Embeddable instead of an entity hierarchy.\n"},{"id":73,"path":"../..\\..\\..\\..\\..\\xampp\\htdocs\\devonfw.github.io\\website\\pages\\docs/devon4j.asciidoc_guides.html#guide-jpa.asciidoc_repositories-and-daos","type":"docs","title":"Repositories and DAOs","body":"12.3.5. Repositories and DAOs\nFor each entity a code unit is created that groups all database operations for that entity. We recommend to use spring-data repositories for that as it is most efficient for developers. As an alternative there is still the classic approach using DAOs.\nConcurrency Control\nThe concurrency control defines the way concurrent access to the same data of a database is handled. When several users (or threads of application servers) concurrently access a database, anomalies may happen, e.g. a transaction is able to see changes from another transaction although that one did, not yet commit these changes. Most of these anomalies are automatically prevented by the database system, depending on the isolation level (property hibernate.connection.isolation in the jpa.xml, see here).\nAnother anomaly is when two stakeholders concurrently access a record, do some changes and write them back to the database. The JPA addresses this with different locking strategies (see here).\nAs a best practice we are using optimistic locking for regular end-user services (OLTP) and pessimistic locking for batches.\nOptimistic Locking\nThe class com.devonfw.module.jpa.persistence.api.AbstractPersistenceEntity already provides optimistic locking via a modificationCounter with the @Version annotation. Therefore JPA takes care of optimistic locking for you. When entities are transferred to clients, modified and sent back for update you need to ensure the modificationCounter is part of the game. If you follow our guides about transfer-objects and services this will also work out of the box.\nYou only have to care about two things:\nHow to deal with optimistic locking in relationships?\nAssume an entity A contains a collection of B entities. Should there be a locking conflict if one user modifies an instance of A while another user in parallel modifies an instance of B that is contained in the other instance? To address this , take a look at FeatureForceIncrementModificationCounter.\nWhat should happen in the UI if an OptimisticLockException occurred?\nAccording to KISS our recommendation is that the user gets an error displayed that tells him to do his change again on the recent data. Try to design your system and the work processing in a way to keep such conflicts rare and you are fine.\nPessimistic Locking\nFor back-end services and especially for batches optimistic locking is not suitable. A human user shall not cause a large batch process to fail because he was editing the same entity. Therefore such use-cases use pessimistic locking what gives them a kind of priority over the human users.\nIn your DAO implementation you can provide methods that do pessimistic locking via EntityManager operations that take a LockModeType. Here is a simple example:\ngetEntityManager().lock(entity, LockModeType.READ);\nWhen using the lock(Object, LockModeType) method with LockModeType.READ, Hibernate will issue a SELECT &#x2026;&#x200B; FOR UPDATE. This means that no one else can update the entity (see here for more information on the statement). If LockModeType.WRITE is specified, Hibernate issues a SELECT &#x2026;&#x200B; FOR UPDATE NOWAIT instead, which has has the same meaning as the statement above, but if there is already a lock, the program will not wait for this lock to be released. Instead, an exception is raised.\nUse one of the types if you want to modify the entity later on, for read only access no lock is required.\nAs you might have noticed, the behavior of Hibernate deviates from what one would expect by looking at the LockModeType (especially LockModeType.READ should not cause a SELECT &#x2026;&#x200B; FOR UPDATE to be issued). The framework actually deviates from what is specified in the JPA for unknown reasons.\n"},{"id":74,"path":"../..\\..\\..\\..\\..\\xampp\\htdocs\\devonfw.github.io\\website\\pages\\docs/devon4j.asciidoc_guides.html#guide-jpa.asciidoc_database-auditing","type":"docs","title":"Database Auditing","body":"12.3.6.

For other cases you need to write your own query. We distinguish between static and dynamic queries. Static queries have a fixed JPQL query string that may only use parameters to customize the query at runtime. Instead, dynamic queries can change their clauses (WHERE, ORDER BY, JOIN, etc.) at runtime depending on the given search criteria.\nStatic Queries\nE.g. to find all DishEntries (from MTS sample app) that have a price not exceeding a given maxPrice we write the following JPQL query:\nSELECT dish FROM DishEntity dish WHERE dish.price &lt;= :maxPrice\nHere dish is used as alias (variable name) for our selected DishEntity (what refers to the simple name of the Java entity class). With dish.price we are referring to the Java property price (getPrice()/setPrice(&#x2026;&#x200B;)) in DishEntity. A named variable provided from outside (the search criteria at runtime) is specified with a colon (:) as prefix. Here with :maxPrice we reference to a variable that needs to be set via query.setParameter(&quot;maxPrice&quot;, maxPriceValue). JPQL also supports indexed parameters (?) but they are discouraged because they easily cause confusion and mistakes.\nUsing Queries to Avoid Bidirectional Relationships\nWith the usage of queries it is possible to avoid exposing relationships or modelling bidirectional relationships, which have some disadvantages (see relationships). This is especially desired for relationships between entities of different business components.\nSo for example to get all OrderLineEntities for a specific OrderEntity without using the orderLines relation from OrderEntity the following query could be used:\nSELECT line FROM OrderLineEntity line WHERE line.order.id = :orderId\nDynamic Queries\nFor dynamic queries we use QueryDSL. It allows to implement queries in a powerful but readable and type-safe way (unlike Criteria API). If you already know JPQL you will quickly be able to read and write QueryDSL code. It feels like JPQL but implemented in Java instead of plain text.\nPlease be aware that code-generation can be painful especially with large teams. We therefore recommend to use QueryDSL without code-generation. Here is an example from our sample application:\npublic List&lt;DishEntity&gt; findOrders(DishSearchCriteriaTo criteria) {\nDishEntity dish = Alias.alias(DishEntity.class);\nJPAQuery&lt;OrderEntity&gt; query = newDslQuery(alias); // new JPAQuery&lt;&gt;(getEntityManager()).from(Alias.$(dish));\nRange&lt;BigDecimal&gt; priceRange = criteria.getPriceRange();\nif (priceRange != null) {\nBigDecimal min = priceRange.getMin();\nif (min != null) {\nquery.where(Alias.$(order.getPrice()).ge(min));\n}\nBigDecimal max = priceRange.getMax();\nif (max != null) {\nquery.where(Alias.$(order.getPrice()).le(max));\n}\n}\nString name = criteria.getName();\nif ((name != null) &amp;&amp; (!name.isEmpty())) {\n// query.where(Alias.$(alias.getName()).eq(name));\nQueryUtil.get().whereString(query, Alias.$(alias.getName()), name, criteria.getNameOption());\n}\nreturn query.fetch();\n}\nUsing Wildcards\nFor flexible queries it is often required to allow wildcards (especially in dynamic queries). While users intuitively expect glob syntax the SQL and JPQL standards work different. Therefore a mapping is required. devonfw provides this on a lower level by LikePatternSyntax and on a high level by QueryUtil (see QueryHelper.newStringClause(&#x2026;&#x200B;)).\nPagination\ndevonfw provides pagination support. If you are using spring-data repositories you will get that directly from spring for static queries. Otherwise for dynamic or generally handwritten queries we provide this via QueryUtil.findPaginated(&#x2026;&#x200B;):\nboolean determineTotalHitCount = ...;\nreturn QueryUtil.get().findPaginated(criteria.getPageable(), query, determineTotalHitCount);\nPagination example\nFor the table entity we can make a search request by accessing the REST endpoint with pagination support like in the following examples:\nPOST mythaistar/services/rest/tablemanagement/v1/table/search\n{\n&quot;pagination&quot;: {\n&quot;size&quot;:2,\n&quot;total&quot;:true\n}\n}\n//Response\n{\n&quot;pagination&quot;: {\n&quot;size&quot;: 2,\n&quot;page&quot;: 1,\n&quot;total&quot;: 11\n},\n&quot;result&quot;: [\n{\n&quot;id&quot;: 101,\n&quot;modificationCounter&quot;: 1,\n&quot;revision&quot;: null,\n&quot;waiterId&quot;: null,\n&quot;number&quot;: 1,\n&quot;state&quot;: &quot;OCCUPIED&quot;\n},\n{\n&quot;id&quot;: 102,\n&quot;modificationCounter&quot;: 1,\n&quot;revision&quot;: null,\n&quot;waiterId&quot;: null,\n&quot;number&quot;: 2,\n&quot;state&quot;: &quot;FREE&quot;\n}\n]\n}\nNote\nAs we are requesting with the total property set to true the server responds with the total count of rows for the query.\nFor retrieving a concrete page, we provide the page attribute with the desired value. Here we also left out the total property so the server doesn&#x2019;t incur on the effort to calculate it:\nPOST mythaistar/services/rest/tablemanagement/v1/table/search\n{\n&quot;pagination&quot;: {\n&quot;size&quot;:2,\n&quot;page&quot;:2\n}\n}\n//Response\n{\n&quot;pagination&quot;: {\n&quot;size&quot;: 2,\n&quot;page&quot;: 2,\n&quot;total&quot;: null\n},\n&quot;result&quot;: [\n{\n&quot;id&quot;: 103,\n&quot;modificationCounter&quot;: 1,\n&quot;revision&quot;: null,\n&quot;waiterId&quot;: null,\n&quot;number&quot;: 3,\n&quot;state&quot;: &quot;FREE&quot;\n},\n{\n&quot;id&quot;: 104,\n&quot;modificationCounter&quot;: 1,\n&quot;revision&quot;: null,\n&quot;waiterId&quot;: null,\n&quot;number&quot;: 4,\n&quot;state&quot;: &quot;FREE&quot;\n}\n]\n}\nQuery Meta-Parameters\nQueries can have meta-parameters and that are provided via SearchCriteriaTo. Besides paging (see above) we also get timeout support.\nAdvanced Queries\nWriting queries can sometimes get rather complex. The current examples given above only showed very simple basics. Within this topic a lot of advanced features need to be considered like:\nJoins\nConstructor queries\nOrder By (Sorting)\nGrouping\nHaving\nUnions\nSub-Queries\nAggregation functions like e.g. count/avg/sum\nDistinct selections\nSQL Hints (see e.g. Oracle hints or SQL-Server hints) - only when required for ultimate performance tuning\nThis list is just containing the most important aspects. As we can not cover all these topics here, they are linked to external documentation that can help and guide you.\n"},{"id":80,"path":"../..\\..\\..\\..\\..\\xampp\\htdocs\\devonfw.github.io\\website\\pages\\docs/devon4j.asciidoc_guides.html#guide-repository.asciidoc","type":"docs","title":"Spring-Data","body":"12.3.12. Spring-Data\nIf you are using the Spring Framework and have no restrictions regarding that, we recommend to use spring-data-jpa via devon4j-starter-spring-data-jpa that brings advanced integration (esp. for QueryDSL).\nMotivation\nThe benefits of spring-data are (for examples and explanations see next sections):\nAll you need is one single repository interface for each entity. No need for a separate implementation or other code artifacts like XML descriptors, NamedQueries class, etc.\nYou have all information together in one place (the repository interface) that actually belong together (where as in the classic approach you have the static queries in an XML file, constants to them in NamedQueries class and referencing usages in DAO implementation classes).\nStatic queries are most simple to realize as you do not need to write any method body. This means you can develop faster.\nSupport for paging is already build-in. Again for static query method the is nothing you have to do except using the paging objects in the signature.\nStill you have the freedom to write custom implementations via default methods within the repository interface (e.g. for dynamic queries).\nRepository\nFor each entity &#xAB;Entity&#xBB;Entity an interface is created with the name &#xAB;Entity&#xBB;Repository extending DefaultRepository.\nSuch repository is the analogy to a Data-Access-Object (DAO) used in the classic approach or when spring-data is not an option.\nExample\nThe following example shows how to write such a repository:\npublic interface ExampleRepository extends DefaultRepository&lt;ExampleEntity&gt; {\n@Query(&quot;SELECT example FROM ExampleEntity example&quot; //\n+ &quot; WHERE example.name = :name&quot;)\nList&lt;ExampleEntity&gt; findByName(@Param(&quot;name&quot;) String name);\n@Query(&quot;SELECT example FROM ExampleEntity example&quot; //\n+ &quot; WHERE example.name = :name&quot;)\nPage&lt;ExampleEntity&gt; findByNamePaginated(@Param(&quot;name&quot;) String name, Pageable pageable);\ndefault Page&lt;ExampleEntity&gt; findByCriteria(ExampleSearchCriteriaTo criteria) {\nExampleEntity alias = newDslAlias();\nJPAQuery&lt;ExampleEntity&gt; query = newDslQuery(alias);\nString name = criteria.getName();\nif ((name != null) &amp;&amp; !name.isEmpty()) {\nQueryUtil.get().whereString(query, $(alias.getName()), name, criteria.getNameOption());\n}\nreturn QueryUtil.get().findPaginated(criteria.getPageable(), query, false);\n}\n}\nThis ExampleRepository has the following features:\nCRUD support from spring-data (see JavaDoc for details).\nSupport for QueryDSL integration, paging and more as well as locking via GenericRepository\nA static query method findByName to find all ExampleEntity instances from DB that have the given name. Please note the @Param annotation that links the method parameter with the variable inside the query (:name).\nThe same with pagination support via findByNamePaginated method.\nA dynamic query method findByCriteria showing the QueryDSL and paging integration into spring-data provided by devon.\nFurther examples\nYou can also read the JUnit test-case DefaultRepositoryTest that is testing an example\nFooRepository.\nAuditing\nIn case you need auditing, you only need to extend DefaultRevisionedRepository instead of DefaultRepository. The auditing methods can be found in GenericRevisionedRepository.\nDependency\nIn case you want to switch to or add spring-data support to your devon application all you need is this maven dependency:\n&lt;!-- Starter for consuming REST services --&gt;\n&lt;dependency&gt;\n&lt;groupId&gt;com.devonfw.java.starters&lt;/groupId&gt;\n&lt;artifactId&gt;devon4j-starter-spring-data-jpa&lt;/artifactId&gt;\n&lt;/dependency&gt;\nDrawbacks\nSpring-data also has some drawbacks:\nSome kind of magic behind the scenes that are not so easy to understand. So in case you want to extend all your repositories without providing the implementation via a default method in a parent repository interface you need to deep-dive into spring-data. We assume that you do not need that and hope what spring-data and devon already provides out-of-the-box is already sufficient.\nThe spring-data magic also includes guessing the query from the method name. This is not easy to understand and especially to debug. Our suggestion is not to use this feature at all and either provide a @Query annotation or an implementation via default method.\n"},{"id":81,"path":"../..\\..\\..\\..\\..\\xampp\\htdocs\\devonfw.github.io\\website\\pages\\docs/devon4j.asciidoc_guides.html#guide-dao.asciidoc","type":"docs","title":"Data Access Object","body":"12.3.13. Data Access Object\nThe Data Access Objects (DAOs) are part of the persistence layer.\nThey are responsible for a specific entity and should be named &#xAB;Entity&#xBB;Dao and &#xAB;Entity&#xBB;DaoImpl.\nThe DAO offers the so called CRUD-functionalities (create, retrieve, update, delete) for the corresponding entity.\nAdditionally a DAO may offer advanced operations such as query or locking methods.\nDAO Interface\nFor each DAO there is an interface named &#xAB;Entity&#xBB;Dao that defines the API. For CRUD support and common naming we derive it from the ApplicationDao interface that comes with the devon application template:\npublic interface MyEntityDao extends ApplicationDao&lt;MyEntity&gt; {\nList&lt;MyEntity&gt; findByCriteria(MyEntitySearchCriteria criteria);\n}\nAll CRUD operations are inherited from ApplicationDao so you only have to declare the additional methods.\nDAO Implementation\nImplementing a DAO is quite simple. We create a class named &#xAB;Entity&#xBB;DaoImpl that extends ApplicationDaoImpl and implements your &#xAB;Entity&#xBB;Dao interface:\npublic class MyEntityDaoImpl extends ApplicationDaoImpl&lt;MyEntity&gt; implements MyEntityDao {\npublic List&lt;MyEntity&gt; findByCriteria(MyEntitySearchCriteria criteria) {\nTypedQuery&lt;MyEntity&gt; query = createQuery(criteria, getEntityManager());\nreturn query.getResultList();\n}\n...\n}\nAgain you only need to implement the additional non-CRUD methods that you have declared in your &#xAB;Entity&#xBB;Dao interface.\nIn the DAO implementation you can use the method getEntityManager() to access the EntityManager from the JPA. You will need the EntityManager to create and execute queries.\nStatic queries for DAO Implementation\nAll static queries are declared in the file src\\main\\resources\\META-INF\\orm.xml:\n&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;?&gt;\n&lt;entity-mappings version=&quot;1.0&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/persistence/orm&quot; xmlns:xsi=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance&quot;\nxsi:schemaLocation=&quot;http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/persistence/orm http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/persistence/orm_1_0.xsd&quot;&gt;\n&lt;named-query name=&quot;find.dish.with.max.price&quot;&gt;\n&lt;query&gt;&lt;![SELECT dish FROM DishEntity dish WHERE dish.price &lt;= :maxPrice]]&gt;&lt;/query&gt;\n&lt;/named-query&gt;\n...\n&lt;/hibernate-mapping&gt;\nWhen your application is started, all these static queries will be created as prepared statements. This allows better performance and also ensures that you get errors for invalid JPQL queries when you start your app rather than later when the query is used.\nTo avoid redundant occurrences of the query name (get.open.order.positions.for.order) we define a constant for each named query:\npublic class NamedQueries {\npublic static final String FIND_DISH_WITH_MAX_PRICE = &quot;find.dish.with.max.price&quot;;\n}\nNote that changing the name of the java constant (FIND_DISH_WITH_MAX_PRICE) can be done easily with refactoring. Further you can trace where the query is used by searching the references of the constant.\nThe following listing shows how to use this query:\npublic List&lt;DishEntity&gt; findDishByMaxPrice(BigDecimal maxPrice) {\nQuery query = getEntityManager().createNamedQuery(NamedQueries.FIND_DISH_WITH_MAX_PRICE);\nquery.setParameter(&quot;maxPrice&quot;, maxPrice);\nreturn query.getResultList();\n}\nVia EntityManager.createNamedQuery(String) we create an instance of Query for our predefined static query.\nNext we use setParameter(String, Object) to provide a parameter (maxPrice) to the query. This has to be done for all parameters of the query.\nNote that using the createQuery(String) method, which takes the entire query as string (that may already contain the parameter) is not allowed to avoid SQL injection vulnerabilities.\nWhen the method getResultList() is invoked, the query is executed and the result is delivered as List. As an alternative, there is a method called getSingleResult(), which returns the entity if the query returned exactly one and throws an exception otherwise.\n"},{"id":82,"path":"../..\\..\\..\\..\\..\\xampp\\htdocs\\devonfw.github.io\\website\\pages\\docs/devon4j.asciidoc_guides.html#guide-jpa-performance.asciidoc","type":"docs","title":"JPA Performance","body":"12.3.14. JPA Performance\nWhen using JPA the developer sometimes does not see or understand where and when statements to the database are triggered.\nEstablishing expectations Developers shouldn&#x2019;t expect to sprinkle magic pixie dust on POJOs in hopes they will become persistent.\n&#x2014; Dan Allen\nhttps://epdf.tips/seam-in-action.html\nSo in case you do not understand what is going on under the hood of JPA, you will easily run into performance issues due to lazy loading and other effects.\nN plus 1 Problem\nThe most prominent phenomena is call the N+1 Problem.\nWe use entities from our MTS demo app as an example to explain the problem.\nThere is a DishEntity that has a @ManyToMany relation to\nIngredientEntity.\nNow we assume that we want to iterate all ingredients for a dish like this:\nDishEntity dish = dao.findDishById(dishId);\nBigDecimal priceWithAllExtras = dish.getPrice();\nfor (IngredientEntity ingredient : dish.getExtras()) {\npriceWithAllExtras = priceWithAllExtras.add(ingredient.getPrice());\n}\nNow dish.getExtras() is loaded lazy. Therefore the JPA vendor will provide a list with lazy initialized instances of IngredientEntity that only contain the ID of that entity. Now with every call of ingredient.getPrice() we technically trigger an SQL query statement to load the specific IngredientEntity by its ID from the database.\nNow findDishById caused 1 initial query statement and for any number N of ingredients we are causing an additional query statement. This makes a total of N+1 statements. As causing statements to the database is an expensive operation with a lot of overhead (creating connection, etc.) this ends in bad performance and is therefore a problem (the N+1 Problem).\nSolving N plus 1 Problem\nTo solve the N+1 Problem you need to change your code to only trigger a single statement instead. This can be archived in various ways. The most universal solution is to use FETCH JOIN in order to pre-load the nested N child entities into the first level cache of the JPA vendor implementation. This will behave very similar as if the @ManyToMany relation to IngredientEntity was having FetchType.EAGER but only for the specific query and not in general. Because changing @ManyToMany to FetchType.EAGER would cause bad performance for other usecases where only the dish but not its extra ingredients are needed. For this reason all relations, including @OneToOne should always be FetchType.LAZY. Back to our example we simply replace dao.findDishById(dishId) with dao.findDishWithExtrasById(dishId) that we implement by the following JPQL query:\nSELECT dish FROM DishEntity dish\nLEFT JOIN FETCH dish.extras\nWHERE dish.id = :dishId\nThe rest of the code does not have to be changed but now dish.getExtras() will get the IngredientEntity from the first level cache where is was fetched by the initial query above.\nPlease note that if you only need the sum of the prices from the extras you can also create a query using an aggregator function:\nSELECT sum(dish.extras.price) FROM DishEntity dish\nAs you can see you need to understand the concepts in order to get good performance.\nThere are many advanced topics such as creating database indexes or calculating statistics for the query optimizer to get the best performance. For such advanced topics we recommend to have a database expert in your team that cares about such things. However, understanding the N+1 Problem and its solutions is something that every Java developer in the team needs to understand.\n"},{"id":83,"path":"../..\\..\\..\\..\\..\\xampp\\htdocs\\devonfw.github.io\\website\\pages\\docs/devon4j.asciidoc_guides.html#guide-auditing.asciidoc","type":"docs","title":"Auditing","body":"12.4.

For details consult the logback configuration manual. devon4j provides a production ready configuration here. Simply copy this configuration into your application in order to benefit from the provided operational and security aspects. We do not include the configuration into the devon4j-logging module to give you the freedom of customizations (e.g. tune log levels for components and integrated products and libraries of your application).\nThe provided logback.xml is configured to use variables defined on the config/application.properties file. On our example, the log files path point to ../logs/ in order to log to tomcat log directory when starting tomcat on the bin folder. Change it according to your custom needs.\nListing 8. config/application.properties\nlog.dir=../logs/\nLogger Access\nThe general pattern for accessing loggers from your code is a static logger instance per class. We pre-configured the development environment so you can just type LOG and hit [ctrl][space] (and then [arrow up]) to insert the code pattern line into your class:\npublic class MyClass {\nprivate static final Logger LOG = LoggerFactory.getLogger(MyClass.class);\n...\n}\nPlease note that in this case we are not using injection pattern but use the convenient static alternative. This is already a common solution and also has performance benefits.\nHow to log\nWe use a common understanding of the log-levels as illustrated by the following table. This helps for better maintenance and operation of the systems by combining both views.\nTable 28.

Authentication\nDefinition:\nAuthentication is the verification that somebody interacting with the system is the actual subject for whom he claims to be.\nThe one authenticated is properly called subject or principal. However, for simplicity we use the common term user even though it may not be a human (e.g. in case of a service call from an external system).\nTo prove his authenticity the user provides some secret called credentials. The most simple form of credentials is a password.\nNote\nPlease never implement your own authentication mechanism or credential store. You have to be aware of implicit demands such as salting and hashing credentials, password life-cycle with recovery, expiry, and renewal including email notification confirmation tokens, central password policies, etc. This is the domain of access managers and identity management systems. In a business context you will typically already find a system for this purpose that you have to integrate (e.g. via LDAP). Otherwise you should consider establishing such a system e.g. using keycloak.\nWe use spring-security as a framework for authentication purposes.\nTherefore you need to provide an implementation of WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter:\n@Configuration\n@EnableWebSecurity\npublic class MyWebSecurityConfig extends WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter {\n@Inject\nprivate UserDetailsService userDetailsService;\n...\npublic void configure(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {\nhttp.userDetailsService(this.userDetailsService)\n.authorizeRequests().antMatchers(&quot;/public/**&quot;).permitAll()\n.anyRequest().authenticated().and()\n...\n}\n}\nAs you can see spring-security offers a fluent API for easy configuration. You can simply add invocations like formLogin().loginPage(&quot;/public/login&quot;) or httpBasic().realmName(&quot;MyApp&quot;). Also CSRF protection can be configured by invoking csrf().\nFor further details see spring Java-config for HTTP security.\nFurther, you need to provide an implementation of the UserDetailsService interface.\nA good starting point comes with our application template.\nPreserve original request anchors after form login redirect\nSpring Security will automatically redirect any unauthorized access to the defined login-page. After successful login, the user will be redirected to the original requested URL. The only pitfall is, that anchors in the request URL will not be transmitted to server and thus cannot be restored after successful login. Therefore the devon4j-security module provides the RetainAnchorFilter, which is able to inject javascript code to the source page and to the target page of any redirection. Using javascript this filter is able to retrieve the requested anchors and store them into a cookie. Heading the target URL this cookie will be used to restore the original anchors again.\nTo enable this mechanism you have to integrate the RetainAnchorFilter as follows:\nFirst, declare the filter with\nstoreUrlPattern: an regular expression matching the URL, where anchors should be stored\nrestoreUrlPattern: an regular expression matching the URL, where anchors should be restored\ncookieName: the name of the cookie to save the anchors in the intermediate time\nYou can easily configure this as code in your WebSecurityConfig as following:\nRetainAnchorFilter filter = new RetainAnchorFilter();\nfilter.setStoreUrlPattern(&quot;http://[^/]+/[^/]+/login.*&quot;);\nfilter.setRestoreUrlPattern(&quot;http://[^/]+/[^/]+/.*&quot;);\nfilter.setCookieName(&quot;TARGETANCHOR&quot;);\nhttp.addFilterBefore(filter, UsernamePasswordAuthenticationFilter.class);\nUsers vs. Systems\nIf we are talking about authentication we have to distinguish two forms of principals:\nhuman users\nautonomous systems\nWhile e.g. a Kerberos/SPNEGO Single-Sign-On makes sense for human users it is pointless for authenticating autonomous systems. So always keep this in mind when you design your authentication mechanisms and separate access for human users from access for systems.\nUsing JWT\nFor authentication via JSON Web Token (JWT) see JWT guide.\nMixed Authentication\nIn rare cases you might need to mix multiple authentication mechanisms (form based, basic-auth, SAMLv2, OAuth, etc.) within the same app (for different URLs). For KISS this should be avoided where possible. However, when needed, you can find a solution\nhere.\n"},{"id":103,"path":"../..\\..\\..\\..\\..\\xampp\\htdocs\\devonfw.github.io\\website\\pages\\docs/devon4j.asciidoc_guides.html#guide-access-control.asciidoc_authorization","type":"docs","title":"Authorization","body":"12.10.2. Authorization\nDefinition:\nAuthorization is the verification that an authenticated user is allowed to perform the operation he intends to invoke.\nClarification of terms\nFor clarification we also want to give a common understanding of related terms that have no unique definition and consistent usage in the wild.\nTable 31. Security terms related to authorization\nTerm\nMeaning and comment\nPermission\nA permission is an object that allows a principal to perform an operation in the system. This permission can be granted (give) or revoked (taken away). Sometimes people also use the term right what is actually wrong as a right (such as the right to be free) can not be revoked.\nGroup\nWe use the term group in this context for an object that contains permissions. A group may also contain other groups. Then the group represents the set of all recursively contained permissions.\nRole\nWe consider a role as a specific form of group that also contains permissions. A role identifies a specific function of a principal. A user can act in a role.\nFor simple scenarios a principal has a single role associated. In more complex situations a principal can have multiple roles but has only one active role at a time that he can choose out of his assigned roles. For KISS it is sometimes sufficient to avoid this by creating multiple accounts for the few users with multiple roles. Otherwise at least avoid switching roles at run-time in clients as this may cause problems with related states. Simply restart the client with the new role as parameter in case the user wants to switch his role.\nAccess Control\nAny permission, group, role, etc., which declares a control for access management.\nSuggestions on the access model\nFor the access model we give the following suggestions:\nEach Access Control (permission, group, role, &#x2026;&#x200B;) is uniquely identified by a human readable string.\nWe create a unique permission for each use-case.\nWe define groups that combine permissions to typical and useful sets for the users.\nWe define roles as specific groups as required by our business demands.\nWe allow to associate users with a list of Access Controls.\nFor authorization of an implemented use case we determine the required permission. Furthermore, we determine the current user and verify that the required permission is contained in the tree spanned by all his associated Access Controls. If the user does not have the permission we throw a security exception and thus abort the operation and transaction.\nWe avoid negative permissions, that is a user has no permission by default and only those granted to him explicitly give him additional permission for specific things. Permissions granted can not be reduced by other permissions.\nTechnically we consider permissions as a secret of the application. Administrators shall not fiddle with individual permissions but grant them via groups. So the access management provides a list of strings identifying the Access Controls of a user. The individual application itself contains these Access Controls in a structured way, whereas each group forms a permission tree.\nNaming conventions\nAs stated above each Access Control is uniquely identified by a human readable string. This string should follow the naming convention:\n&#xAB;app-id&#xBB;.&#xAB;local-name&#xBB;\nFor Access Control Permissions the &#xAB;local-name&#xBB; again follows the convention:\n&#xAB;verb&#xBB;&#xAB;object&#xBB;\nThe segments are defined by the following table:\nTable 32. Segments of Access Control Permission ID\nSegment\nDescription\nExample\n&#xAB;app-id&#xBB;\nIs a unique technical but human readable string of the application (or microservice). It shall not contain special characters and especially no dot or whitespace. We recommend to use lower-train-case-ascii-syntax. The identity and access management should be organized on enterprise level rather than application level. Therefore permissions of different apps might easily clash (e.g. two apps might both define a group ReadMasterData but some user shall get this group for only one of these two apps). Using the &#xAB;app-id&#xBB;. prefix is a simple but powerful namespacing concept that allows you to scale and grow. You may also reserve specific &#xAB;app-id&#xBB;s for cross-cutting concerns that do not actually reflect a single app e.g to grant access to a geographic region.\nshop\n&#xAB;verb&#xBB;\nThe action that is to be performed on &#xAB;object&#xBB;. We use Find for searching and reading data. Save shall be used both for create and update. Only if you really have demands to separate these two you may use Create in addition to Save. Finally, Delete is used for deletions. For non CRUD actions you are free to use additional verbs such as Approve or Reject.\nFind\n&#xAB;object&#xBB;\nThe affected object or entity. Shall be named according to your data-model\nProduct\nSo as an example shop.FindProduct will reflect the permission to search and retrieve a Product in the shop application. The group shop.ReadMasterData may combine all permissions to read master-data from the shop. However, also a group shop.Admin may exist for the Admin role of the shop application. Here the &#xAB;local-name&#xBB; is Admin that does not follow the &#xAB;verb&#xBB;&#xAB;object&#xBB; schema.\ndevon4j-security\nThe module devon4j-security provides ready-to-use code based on spring-security that makes your life a lot easier.\nFigure 6. devon4j Security Model\nThe diagram shows the model of devon4j-security that separates two different aspects:\nThe Identity- and Access-Management is provided by according products and typically already available in the enterprise landscape (e.g. an active directory). It provides a hierarchy of primary access control objects (roles and groups) of a user. An administrator can grant and revoke permissions (indirectly) via this way.\nThe application security defines a hierarchy of secondary access control objects (groups and permissions). This is done by configuration owned by the application (see following section). The &quot;API&quot; is defined by the IDs of the primary access control objects that will be referenced from the Identity- and Access-Management.\nAccess Control Config\nIn your application simply extend AccessControlConfig to configure your access control objects as code and reference it from your use-cases. An example config may look like this:\n@Named\npublic class ApplicationAccessControlConfig extends AccessControlConfig {\npublic static final String APP_ID = &quot;MyApp&quot;;\nprivate static final String PREFIX = APP_ID + &quot;.&quot;;\npublic static final String PERMISSION_FIND_OFFER = PREFIX + &quot;FindOffer&quot;;\npublic static final String PERMISSION_SAVE_OFFER = PREFIX + &quot;SaveOffer&quot;;\npublic static final String PERMISSION_DELETE_OFFER = PREFIX + &quot;DeleteOffer&quot;;\npublic static final String PERMISSION_FIND_PRODUCT = PREFIX + &quot;FindProduct&quot;;\npublic static final String PERMISSION_SAVE_PRODUCT = PREFIX + &quot;SaveProduct&quot;;\npublic static final String PERMISSION_DELETE_PRODUCT = PREFIX + &quot;DeleteProduct&quot;;\npublic static final String GROUP_READ_MASTER_DATA = PREFIX + &quot;ReadMasterData&quot;;\npublic static final String GROUP_MANAGER = PREFIX + &quot;Manager&quot;;\npublic static final String GROUP_ADMIN = PREFIX + &quot;Admin&quot;;\npublic ApplicationAccessControlConfig() {\nsuper();\nAccessControlGroup readMasterData = group(GROUP_READ_MASTER_DATA, PERMISSION_FIND_OFFER, PERMISSION_FIND_PRODUCT);\nAccessControlGroup manager = group(GROUP_MANAGER, readMasterData, PERMISSION_SAVE_OFFER, PERMISSION_SAVE_PRODUCT);\nAccessControlGroup admin = group(GROUP_ADMIN, manager, PERMISSION_DELETE_OFFER, PERMISSION_DELETE_PRODUCT);\n}\n}\nConfiguration on Java Method level\nIn your use-case you can now reference a permission like this:\n@Named\npublic class UcSafeOfferImpl extends ApplicationUc implements UcSafeOffer {\n@Override\n@RolesAllowed(ApplicationAccessControlConfig.PERMISSION_SAVE_OFFER)\npublic OfferEto save(OfferEto offer) { ... }\n...\n}\nCheck Data-Permissions\nSee data permissions\nAccess Control Schema (deprecated)\nThe access-control-schema.xml approach is deprecated.

Thus we have to provide an AuthenticationProvider, which is provided from Spring Security as an interface for authentication and authorization simultaneously.\nTo integrate the devon4j-security provided access control schema, you can simply inherit your own implementation from the devon4j-security provided abstract class AbstractAccessControlBasedAuthenticationProvider and register your ApplicationAuthenticationProvider as an AuthenticationManager. Doing so, you also have to declare the two Beans AccessControlProvider and AccessControlSchemaProvider, which are precondition for the AbstractAccessControlBasedAuthenticationProvider.\nAs state of the art devon4j will focus on role-based authorization to cope with authorization for executing use case of an application.\nWe will use the JSR250 annotations, mainly @RolesAllowed, for authorizing method calls against the permissions defined in the annotation body. This has to be done for each use-case method in logic layer. Here is an example:\npublic class OrdermanagementImpl extends AbstractComponentFacade implements Ordermanagement {\n@RolesAllowed(Roles.WAITER)\npublic PaginatedListTo&lt;OrderCto&gt; findOrdersByPost(OrderSearchCriteriaTo criteria) {\nreturn findOrderCtos(criteria);\n}\n}\nNow this method can only be called if a user is logged-in that has the permission FIND_TABLE.\n"},{"id":106,"path":"../..\\..\\..\\..\\..\\xampp\\htdocs\\devonfw.github.io\\website\\pages\\docs/devon4j.asciidoc_guides.html#guide-data-permission.asciidoc","type":"docs","title":"Data-permissions","body":"12.11.2. Data-permissions\nIn some projects there are demands for permissions and authorization that is dependent on the processed data. E.g. a user may only be allowed to read or write data for a specific region. This is adding some additional complexity to your authorization. If you can avoid this it is always best to keep things simple. However, in various cases this is a requirement. Therefore the following sections give you guidance and patterns how to solve this properly.\nStructuring your data\nFor all your business objects (entities) that have to be secured regarding to data permissions we recommend that you create a separate interface that provides access to the relevant data required to decide about the permission. Here is a simple example:\npublic interface SecurityDataPermissionCountry {\n/**\n* @return the 2-letter ISO code of the country this object is associated with. Users need\n* a data-permission for this country in order to read and write this object.\n*/\nString getCountry();\n}\nNow related business objects (entities) can implement this interface. Often such data-permissions have to be applied to an entire object-hierarchy. For security reasons we recommend that also all child-objects implement this interface. For performance reasons we recommend that the child-objects redundantly store the data-permission properties (such as country in the example above) and this gets simply propagated from the parent, when a child object is created.\nPermissions for processing data\nWhen saving or processing objects with a data-permission, we recommend to provide dedicated methods to verify the permission in an abstract base-class such as AbstractUc and simply call this explicitly from your business code. This makes it easy to understand and debug the code. Here is a simple example:\nprotected void verifyPermission(SecurityDataPermissionCountry entity) throws AccessDeniedException;\nBeware of AOP\nFor simple but cross-cutting data-permissions you may also use AOP. This leads to programming aspects that reflectively scan method arguments and magically decide what to do. Be aware that this quickly gets tricky:\nWhat if multiple of your method arguments have data-permissions (e.g. implement SecurityDataPermission*)?\nWhat if the object to authorize is only provided as reference (e.g. Long or IdRef) and only loaded and processed inside the implementation where the AOP aspect does not apply?\nHow to express advanced data-permissions in annotations?\nWhat we have learned is that annotations like @PreAuthorize from spring-security easily lead to the &quot;programming in string literals&quot; anti-pattern. We strongly discourage to use this anti-pattern. In such case writing your own verifyPermission methods that you manually call in the right places of your business-logic is much better to understand, debug and maintain.\nPermissions for reading data\nWhen it comes to restrictions on the data to read it becomes even more tricky. In the context of a user only entities shall be loaded from the database he is permitted to read. This is simple for loading a single entity (e.g. by its ID) as you can load it and then if not permitted throw an exception to secure your code. But what if the user is performing a search query to find many entities? For performance reasons we should only find data the user is permitted to read and filter all the rest already via the database query. But what if this is not a requirement for a single query but needs to be applied cross-cutting to tons of queries? Therefore we have the following pattern that solves your problem:\nFor each data-permission attribute (or set of such) we create an abstract base entity:\n@MappedSuperclass\n@EntityListeners(PermissionCheckListener.class)\n@FilterDef(name = &quot;country&quot;, parameters = {@ParamDef(name = &quot;countries&quot;, type = &quot;string&quot;)})\n@Filter(name = &quot;country&quot;, condition = &quot;country in (:countries)&quot;)\npublic abstract class SecurityDataPermissionCountryEntity extends ApplicationPersistenceEntity\nimplements SecurityDataPermissionCountry {\nprivate String country;\n@Override\npublic String getCountry() {\nreturn this.country;\n}\npublic void setCountry(String country) {\nthis.country = country;\n}\n}\nThere are some special hibernate annotations @EntityListeners, @FilterDef, and @Filter used here allowing to apply a filter on the country for any (non-native) query performed by hibernate. The entity listener may look like this:\npublic class PermissionCheckListener {\n@PostLoad\npublic void read(SecurityDataPermissionCountryEntity entity) {\nPermissionChecker.getInstance().requireReadPermission(entity);\n}\n@PrePersist\n@PreUpdate\npublic void write(SecurityDataPermissionCountryEntity entity) {\nPermissionChecker.getInstance().requireWritePermission(entity);\n}\n}\nThis will ensure that hibernate implicitly will call these checks for every such entity when it is read from or written to the database. Further to avoid reading entities from the database the user is not permitted to (and ending up with exceptions), we create an AOP aspect that automatically activates the above declared hibernate filter:\n@Named\npublic class PermissionCheckerAdvice implements MethodBeforeAdvice {\n@Inject\nprivate PermissionChecker permissionChecker;\n@PersistenceContext\nprivate EntityManager entityManager;\n@Override\npublic void before(Method method, Object[] args, Object target) {\nCollection&lt;String&gt; permittedCountries = this.permissionChecker.getPermittedCountriesForReading();\nif (permittedCountries != null) { // null is returned for admins that may access all countries\nif (permittedCountries.isEmpty()) {\nthrow new AccessDeniedException(&quot;Not permitted for any country!&quot;);\n}\nSession session = this.entityManager.unwrap(Session.class);\nsession.enableFilter(&quot;country&quot;).setParameterList(&quot;countries&quot;, permittedCountries.toArray());\n}\n}\n}\nFinally to apply this aspect to all Repositories (can easily be changed to DAOs) implement the following advisor:\n@Named\npublic class PermissionCheckerAdvisor implements PointcutAdvisor, Pointcut, ClassFilter, MethodMatcher {\n@Inject\nprivate PermissionCheckerAdvice advice;\n@Override\npublic Advice getAdvice() {\nreturn this.advice;\n}\n@Override\npublic boolean isPerInstance() {\nreturn false;\n}\n@Override\npublic Pointcut getPointcut() {\nreturn this;\n}\n@Override\npublic ClassFilter getClassFilter() {\nreturn this;\n}\n@Override\npublic MethodMatcher getMethodMatcher() {\nreturn this;\n}\n@Override\npublic boolean matches(Method method, Class&lt;?&gt; targetClass) {\nreturn true; // apply to all methods\n}\n@Override\npublic boolean isRuntime() {\nreturn false;\n}\n@Override\npublic boolean matches(Method method, Class&lt;?&gt; targetClass, Object... args) {\nthrow new IllegalStateException(&quot;isRuntime()==false&quot;);\n}\n@Override\npublic boolean matches(Class&lt;?&gt; clazz) {\n// when using DAOs simply change to some class like ApplicationDao\nreturn DefaultRepository.class.isAssignableFrom(clazz);\n}\n}\nManaging and granting the data-permissions\nFollowing our authorization guide we can simply create a permission for each country. We might simply reserve a prefix (as virtual &#xAB;app-id&#xBB;) for each data-permission to allow granting data-permissions to end-users across all applications of the IT landscape. In our example we could create access controls country.DE, country.US, country.ES, etc. and assign those to the users. The method permissionChecker.getPermittedCountriesForReading() would then scan for these access controls and only return the 2-letter country code from it.\nCaution\nBefore you make your decisions how to design your access controls please clarify the following questions:\nDo you need to separate data-permissions independent of the functional permissions? E.g. may it be required to express that a user can read data from the countries ES and PL but is only permitted to modify data from PL? In such case a single assignment of &quot;country-permissions&quot; to users is insufficient.\nDo you want to grant data-permissions individually for each application (higher flexibility and complexity) or for the entire application landscape (simplicity, better maintenance for administrators)? In case of the first approach you would rather have access controls like app1.country.GB and app2.country.GB.\nDo your data-permissions depend on objects that can be created dynamically inside your application?\nIf you want to grant data-permissions on other business objects (entities), how do you want to reference them (primary keys, business keys, etc.)? What reference is most stable? Which is most readable?\n"},{"id":107,"path":"../..\\..\\..\\..\\..\\xampp\\htdocs\\devonfw.github.io\\website\\pages\\docs/devon4j.asciidoc_guides.html#guide-jwt.asciidoc","type":"docs","title":"JSON Web Token(JWT)","body":"12.12.

Secure devon4j server against CSRF\nIn case your devon4j server application is not accessed by browsers or the web-client is using JWT based authentication, you are already safe according to CSRF.\nHowever, if your application is accessed from a browser and you are using form based authentication (with session coockie) or basic authentication, you need to enable CSRF protection.\nThis guide will tell you how to do this.\nDependency\nTo secure your devon4j application against CSRF attacks, you only need to add the following dependency:\n&lt;dependency&gt;\n&lt;groupId&gt;com.devonfw.java.starters&lt;/groupId&gt;\n&lt;artifactId&gt;devon4j-starter-security-csrf&lt;/artifactId&gt;\n&lt;/dependency&gt;\nStarting with devon4j version 2020.12.001 application template, this is all you need to do.\nHowever, if you have started from an older version or you want to understand more, please read on.\nPluggable web-security\nTo enable pluggable security via devon4j security starters you need to apply WebSecurityConfigurer to your BaseWebSecurityConfig (your class extending spring-boot&#x2019;s WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter) as following:\n@Inject\nprivate WebSecurityConfigurer webSecurityConfigurer;\npublic void configure(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {\n// disable CSRF protection by default, use csrf starter to override.\nhttp = http.csrf().disable();\n// apply pluggable web-security from devon4j security starters\nhttp = this.webSecurityConfigurer.configure(http);\n.....\n}\nCustom CsrfRequestMatcher\nIf you want to customize which HTTP requests will require a CSRF token, you can implement your own CsrfRequestMatcher and provide it to the devon4j CSRF protection via qualified injection as following:\n@Named(&quot;CsrfRequestMatcher&quot;)\npublic class CsrfRequestMatcher implements RequestMatcher {\n@Override\npublic boolean matches(HttpServletRequest request) {\n.....\n}\n}\nPlease note that the exact name (@Named(&quot;CsrfRequestMatcher&quot;)) is required here to ensure your custom implementation will be injected properly.\nCsrfRestService\nWith the devon4j-starter-security-csrf the CsrfRestService gets integrated into your app.\nIt provides an operation to get the CSRF token via an HTTP GET request.\nThe URL path to retrieve this CSRF token is services/rest/csrf/v1/token.\nAs a result you will get a JSON like the following:\n{\n&quot;token&quot;:&quot;3a8a5f66-c9eb-4494-81e1-7cc58bc3a519&quot;,\n&quot;parameterName&quot;:&quot;_csrf&quot;,\n&quot;headerName&quot;:&quot;X-CSRF-TOKEN&quot;\n}\nThe token value is a strong random value that will differ for each user session.\nIt has to be send with subsequent HTTP requests (when method is other than GET) in the specified header (X-CSRF-TOKEN).\nHow it works\nPutting it all together, a browser client should call the CsrfRestService after successfull login to receive the current CSRF token.\nWith every subsequent HTTP request (other than GET) the client has to send this token in the according HTTP header.\nOtherwise the server will reject the request to prevent CSRF attacks.\nTherefore, an attacker might make your browser perform HTTP requests towards your devon4j application backend via &lt;image&gt; elements, &lt;iframes&gt;, etc.\nYour browser will then still include your session coockie if you are already logged in (e.g. from another tab).\nHowever, in case he wants to trigger DELETE or POST requests trying your browser to make changes in the application (delete or update data, etc.) this will fail without CSRF token.\nThe attacker may make your browser retrieve the CSRF token but he will not be able to retrieve the result and put it into the header of other requests due to the same-origin-policy.\nThis way your application will be secured against CSRF attacks.\n"},{"id":116,"path":"../..\\..\\..\\..\\..\\xampp\\htdocs\\devonfw.github.io\\website\\pages\\docs/devon4j.asciidoc_guides.html#guide-csrf.asciidoc_configure-devon4ng-client-for-csrf","type":"docs","title":"Configure devon4ng client for CSRF","body":"12.13.2.

In the latter case design your API to return this as a regular result.\nWe use unchecked exceptions (RuntimeException) [2]\nWe distinguish internal exceptions and user exceptions:\nInternal exceptions have technical reasons. For unexpected and exotic situations it is sufficient to throw existing exceptions such as IllegalStateException. For common scenarios a own exception class is reasonable.\nUser exceptions contain a message explaining the problem for end users. Therefore we always define our own exception classes with a clear, brief but detailed message.\nOur own exceptions derive from an exception base class supporting\nunique ID per instance\nError code per class\nmessage templating (see I18N)\ndistinguish between user exceptions and internal exceptions\nAll this is offered by mmm-util-core that we propose as solution.\n"},{"id":126,"path":"../..\\..\\..\\..\\..\\xampp\\htdocs\\devonfw.github.io\\website\\pages\\docs/devon4j.asciidoc_guides.html#guide-exceptions.asciidoc_exception-example","type":"docs","title":"Exception Example","body":"12.16.2.

Transfer-Objects using Inheritance\nNow assume you have a REST service operation as Java method that takes a ProductEto as argument. As this is an abstract class the server needs to know the actual sub-class to instantiate.\nWe typically do not want to specify the classname in the JSON as this should be an implementation detail and not part of the public JSON format (e.g. in case of a service interface). Therefore we use a symbolic name for each polymorphic subtype that is provided as virtual attribute @type within the JSON data of the object:\n{ &quot;@type&quot;: &quot;Drink&quot;, ... }\nTherefore you add configuration code to the constructor of ApplicationObjectMapperFactory. Here you can see an example from the sample application:\nsetBaseClasses(ProductEto.class);\naddSubtypes(new NamedType(MealEto.class, &quot;Meal&quot;), new NamedType(DrinkEto.class, &quot;Drink&quot;),\nnew NamedType(SideDishEto.class, &quot;SideDish&quot;));\nWe use setBaseClasses to register all top-level classes of polymorphic objects.

Custom Mapping\nIn order to map custom datatypes or other types that do not follow the Java bean conventions, you need to define a custom mapping. If you create objects dedicated for the JSON mapping you can easily avoid such situations. When this is not suitable follow these instructions to define the mapping:\nAs an example, the use of JSR354 (javax.money) is appreciated in order to process monetary amounts properly. However, without custom mapping, the default mapping of Jackson will produce the following JSON for a MonetaryAmount:\n&quot;currency&quot;: {&quot;defaultFractionDigits&quot;:2, &quot;numericCode&quot;:978, &quot;currencyCode&quot;:&quot;EUR&quot;},\n&quot;monetaryContext&quot;: {...},\n&quot;number&quot;:6.99,\n&quot;factory&quot;: {...}\nAs clearly can be seen, the JSON contains too much information and reveals implementation secrets that do not belong here. Instead the JSON output expected and desired would be:\n&quot;currency&quot;:&quot;EUR&quot;,&quot;amount&quot;:&quot;6.99&quot;\nEven worse, when we send the JSON data to the server, Jackson will see that MonetaryAmount is an interface and does not know how to instantiate it so the request will fail.\nTherefore we need a customized Serializer.\nWe implement MonetaryAmountJsonSerializer to define how a MonetaryAmount is serialized to JSON:\npublic final class MonetaryAmountJsonSerializer extends JsonSerializer&lt;MonetaryAmount&gt; {\npublic static final String NUMBER = &quot;amount&quot;;\npublic static final String CURRENCY = &quot;currency&quot;;\npublic void serialize(MonetaryAmount value, JsonGenerator jgen, SerializerProvider provider) throws ... {\nif (value != null) {\njgen.writeStartObject();\njgen.writeFieldName(MonetaryAmountJsonSerializer.CURRENCY);\njgen.writeString(value.getCurrency().getCurrencyCode());\njgen.writeFieldName(MonetaryAmountJsonSerializer.NUMBER);\njgen.writeString(value.getNumber().toString());\njgen.writeEndObject();\n}\n}\nFor composite datatypes it is important to wrap the info as an object (writeStartObject() and writeEndObject()). MonetaryAmount provides the information we need by the getCurrency() and getNumber(). So that we can easily write them into the JSON data.\nNext, we implement MonetaryAmountJsonDeserializer to define how a MonetaryAmount is deserialized back as Java object from JSON:\npublic final class MonetaryAmountJsonDeserializer extends AbstractJsonDeserializer&lt;MonetaryAmount&gt; {\nprotected MonetaryAmount deserializeNode(JsonNode node) {\nBigDecimal number = getRequiredValue(node, MonetaryAmountJsonSerializer.NUMBER, BigDecimal.class);\nString currencyCode = getRequiredValue(node, MonetaryAmountJsonSerializer.CURRENCY, String.class);\nMonetaryAmount monetaryAmount =\nMonetaryAmounts.getAmountFactory().setNumber(number).setCurrency(currencyCode).create();\nreturn monetaryAmount;\n}\n}\nFor composite datatypes we extend from AbstractJsonDeserializer as this makes our task easier. So we already get a JsonNode with the parsed payload of our datatype. Based on this API it is easy to retrieve individual fields from the payload without taking care of their order, etc.\nAbstractJsonDeserializer also provides methods such as getRequiredValue to read required fields and get them converted to the desired basis datatype. So we can easily read the amount and currency and construct an instance of MonetaryAmount via the official factory API.\nFinally we need to register our custom (de)serializers with the following configuration code in the constructor of ApplicationObjectMapperFactory:+\nSimpleModule module = getExtensionModule();\nmodule.addDeserializer(MonetaryAmount.class, new MonetaryAmountJsonDeserializer());\nmodule.addSerializer(MonetaryAmount.class, new MonetaryAmountJsonSerializer());\nNow we can read and write MonetaryAmount from and to JSON as expected.\n"},{"id":139,"path":"../..\\..\\..\\..\\..\\xampp\\htdocs\\devonfw.github.io\\website\\pages\\docs/devon4j.asciidoc_guides.html#guide-rest.asciidoc","type":"docs","title":"REST","body":"12.20.

URLs\nURLs are not case sensitive. Hence, we follow the best practice to use only lower-case-letters-with-hyphen-to-separate-words.\nFor operations in REST we distinguish the following types of URLs:\nA collection URL is build from the rest service URL by appending the name of a collection. This is typically the name of an entity. Such URI identifies the entire collection of all elements of this type. Example: https://mydomain.com/myapp/services/rest/mycomponent/v1/myentity\nAn element URL is build from a collection URL by appending an element ID. It identifies a single element (entity) within the collection. Example: https://mydomain.com/myapp/services/rest/mycomponent/v1/myentity/42\nA search URL is build from a collection URL by appending the segment search. The search criteria is send as POST. Example: https://mydomain.com/myapp/services/rest/mycomponent/v1/myentity/search\nThis fits perfect for CRUD operations. For business operations (processing, calculation, etc.) we simply create a collection URL with the name of the business operation instead of the entity name (use a clear naming convention to avoid collisions). Then we can POST the input for the business operation and get the result back.\nIf you want to provide an entity with a different structure do not append further details to an element URL but create a separate collection URL as base.\nSo use https://mydomain.com/myapp/services/rest/mycomponent/v1/myentity-with-details/42 instead of https://mydomain.com/myapp/services/rest/mycomponent/v1/myentity/42/with-details.\nFor offering a CTO simply append -cto to the collection URL (e.g. &#x2026;&#x200B;/myentity-cto/).\n"},{"id":141,"path":"../..\\..\\..\\..\\..\\xampp\\htdocs\\devonfw.github.io\\website\\pages\\docs/devon4j.asciidoc_guides.html#guide-rest.asciidoc_http-methods","type":"docs","title":"HTTP Methods","body":"12.20.2.

JAX-RS\nFor implementing REST services we use the JAX-RS standard. As an implementation we recommend CXF. For JSON bindings we use Jackson while XML binding works out-of-the-box with JAXB.\nTo implement a service you write an interface with JAX-RS annotations for the API and a regular implementation class annotated with @Named to make it a spring-bean. Here is a simple example:\n@Path(&quot;/imagemanagement/v1&quot;)\n@Consumes(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON)\n@Produces(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON)\npublic interface ImagemanagementRestService {\n@GET\n@Path(&quot;/image/{id}/&quot;)\npublic ImageEto getImage(@PathParam(&quot;id&quot;) long id);\n}\n@Named(&quot;ImagemanagementRestService&quot;)\npublic class ImagemanagementRestServiceImpl implements ImagemanagementRestService {\n@Inject\nprivate Imagemanagement imagemanagement;\n@Override\npublic ImageEto getImage(long id) {\nreturn this.imagemanagement.findImage(id);\n}\n}\nHere we can see a REST service for the business component imagemanagement. The method getImage can be accessed via HTTP GET (see @GET) under the URL path imagemanagement/image/{id} (see @Path annotations) where {id} is the ID of the requested table and will be extracted from the URL and provided as parameter id to the method getImage. It will return its result (ImageEto) as JSON (see @Produces - should already be defined as defaults in RestService marker interface). As you can see it delegates to the logic component imagemanagement that contains the actual business logic while the service itself only exposes this logic via HTTP. The REST service implementation is a regular CDI bean that can use dependency injection.\nThe separation of the API as a Java interface allows to use it for service client calls.\nNote\nWith JAX-RS it is important to make sure that each service method is annotated with the proper HTTP method (@GET,@POST,etc.) to avoid unnecessary debugging. So you should take care not to forget to specify one of these annotations.\nJAX-RS Configuration\nStarting from CXF 3.0.0 it is possible to enable the auto-discovery of JAX-RS roots.\nWhen the jaxrs server is instantiated all the scanned root and provider beans (beans annotated with javax.ws.rs.Path and javax.ws.rs.ext.Provider) are configured.\n"},{"id":145,"path":"../..\\..\\..\\..\\..\\xampp\\htdocs\\devonfw.github.io\\website\\pages\\docs/devon4j.asciidoc_guides.html#guide-rest.asciidoc_rest-exception-handling","type":"docs","title":"REST Exception Handling","body":"12.20.6.

We discuss this use on the next points.\nThe following table specifies how to use the HTTP methods (verbs) for collection and element URIs properly (see wikipedia).\nUnparameterized loading of a single resource\nHTTP Method: GET\nURL example: /services/rest/productmanagement/v1/product/123\nFor loading of a single resource, embed the identifier (e.g. 123) of the resource in the URL.\nThe response contains the resource in JSON format, using a JSON object at the top-level, for example:\n{\n&quot;id&quot;: 123,\n&quot;name&quot;: &quot;Steak&quot;,\n&quot;color&quot;: &quot;brown&quot;\n}\nUnparameterized loading of a collection of resources\nHTTP Method: GET\nURL example: /services/rest/productmanagement/v1/product\nFor loading of a collection of resources, make sure that the size of the collection can never exceed a reasonable maximum size. For parameterized loading (searching, pagination), see below.\nThe response contains the collection in JSON format, using a JSON object at the top-level, and the actual collection underneath a result key, for example:\n{\n&quot;result&quot;: [\n{\n&quot;id&quot;: 123,\n&quot;name&quot;: &quot;Steak&quot;,\n&quot;color&quot;: &quot;brown&quot;\n},\n{\n&quot;id&quot;: 124,\n&quot;name&quot;: &quot;Broccoli&quot;,\n&quot;color&quot;: &quot;green&quot;\n}\n]\n}\nSaving a resource\nHTTP Method: POST\nURL example: /services/rest/productmanagement/v1/product\nThe resource will be passed via JSON in the request body. If updating an existing resource, include the resource&#x2019;s identifier in the JSON and not in the URL, in order to avoid ambiguity.\nIf saving was successful, the updated product (e.g. with assigned ID or updated modification counter) is returned.\nIf saving was unsuccessful, refer below for the format to return errors to the client.\nParameterized loading of a resource\nHTTP Method: POST\nURL example: /services/rest/productmanagement/v1/product/search\nIn order to differentiate from an unparameterized load, a special subpath (for example search) is introduced. The parameters are passed via JSON in the request body. An example of a simple, paginated search would be:\n{\n&quot;status&quot;: &quot;OPEN&quot;,\n&quot;pagination&quot;: {\n&quot;page&quot;: 2,\n&quot;size&quot;: 25\n}\n}\nThe response contains the requested page of the collection in JSON format, using a JSON object at the top-level, the actual page underneath a result key, and additional pagination information underneath a pagination key, for example:\n{\n&quot;pagination&quot;: {\n&quot;page&quot;: 2,\n&quot;size&quot;: 25,\n&quot;total&quot;: null\n},\n&quot;result&quot;: [\n{\n&quot;id&quot;: 123,\n&quot;name&quot;: &quot;Steak&quot;,\n&quot;color&quot;: &quot;brown&quot;\n},\n{\n&quot;id&quot;: 124,\n&quot;name&quot;: &quot;Broccoli&quot;,\n&quot;color&quot;: &quot;green&quot;\n}\n]\n}\nCompare the code needed on server side to accept this request:\n@Path(&quot;/category/search&quot;)\n@POST\npublic PaginatedListTo&lt;CategoryEto&gt; findCategorysByPost(CategorySearchCriteriaTo searchCriteriaTo) {\nreturn this.dishmanagement.findCategoryEtos(searchCriteriaTo);\n}\nWith the equivalent code required if doing it the RESTful way by issuing a GET request:\n@Path(&quot;/category/search&quot;)\n@POST @Path(&quot;/order&quot;)\n@GET\npublic PaginatedListTo&lt;CategoryEto&gt; findCategorysByPost( @Context UriInfo info) {\nRequestParameters parameters = RequestParameters.fromQuery(info);\nCategorySearchCriteriaTo criteria = new CategorySearchCriteriaTo();\ncriteria.setName(parameters.get(&quot;name&quot;, Long.class, false));\ncriteria.setDescription(parameters.get(&quot;description&quot;, OrderState.class, false));\ncriteria.setShowOrder(parameters.get(&quot;showOrder&quot;, OrderState.class, false));\nreturn this.dishmanagement.findCategoryEtos(criteria);\n}\nPagination details\nThe client can choose to request a count of the total size of the collection, for example to calculate the total number of available pages. It does so, by specifying the pagination.total property with a value of true.\nThe service is free to honour this request. If it chooses to do so, it returns the total count as the pagination.total property in the response.\nDeletion of a resource\nHTTP Method: DELETE\nURL example: /services/rest/productmanagement/v1/product/123\nFor deletion of a single resource, embed the identifier of the resource in the URL.\nError results\nThe general format for returning an error to the client is as follows:\n{\n&quot;message&quot;: &quot;A human-readable message describing the error&quot;,\n&quot;code&quot;: &quot;A code identifying the concrete error&quot;,\n&quot;uuid&quot;: &quot;An identifier (generally the correlation id) to help identify corresponding requests in logs&quot;\n}\nIf the error is caused by a failed validation of the entity, the above format is extended to also include the list of individual validation errors:\n{\n&quot;message&quot;: &quot;A human-readable message describing the error&quot;,\n&quot;code&quot;: &quot;A code identifying the concrete error&quot;,\n&quot;uuid&quot;: &quot;An identifier (generally the correlation id) to help identify corresponding requests in logs&quot;,\n&quot;errors&quot;: {\n&quot;property failing validation&quot;: [\n&quot;First error message on this property&quot;,\n&quot;Second error message on this property&quot;\n],\n// ....\n}\n}\n"},{"id":147,"path":"../..\\..\\..\\..\\..\\xampp\\htdocs\\devonfw.github.io\\website\\pages\\docs/devon4j.asciidoc_guides.html#guide-rest.asciidoc_rest-media-types","type":"docs","title":"REST Media Types","body":"12.20.8.

Features\nWhen invoking a service you need to consider many cross-cutting aspects. You might not think about them in the very first place and you do not want to implement them multiple times redundantly. Therefore you should consider using this approach. The following sub-sections list the covered features and aspects:\nSimple usage\nAssuming you already have a Java interface MyService of the service you want to invoke:\npackage com.company.department.foo.mycomponent.service.api.rest;\n...\n@Path(&quot;/myservice&quot;)\npublic interface MyService extends RestService {\n@POST\n@Path(&quot;/getresult&quot;)\nMyResult getResult(MyArgs myArgs);\n@DELETE\n@Path(&quot;/entity/{id}&quot;)\nvoid deleteEntity(@PathParam(&quot;id&quot;) long id);\n}\nThen all you need to do is this:\n@Named\npublic class UcMyUseCaseImpl extends MyUseCaseBase implements UcMyUseCase {\n@Inject\nprivate ServiceClientFactory serviceClientFactory;\n...\nprivate void callSynchronous(MyArgs myArgs) {\nMyService myService = this.serviceClientFactory.create(MyService.class);\n// call of service over the wire, synchronously blocking until result is received or error occurred\nMyResult myResult = myService.myMethod(myArgs);\nhandleResult(myResult);\n}\nprivate void callAsynchronous(MyArgs myArgs) {\nAsyncServiceClient&lt;MyService&gt; client = this.serviceClientFactory.createAsync(MyService.class);\n// call of service over the wire, will return when request is send and invoke handleResult asynchronously\nclient.call(client.get().myMethod(myArgs), this::handleResult);\n}\nprivate void handleResult(MyResult myResult) {\n...\n}\n...\n}\nAs you can see both synchronous and asynchronous invocation of a service is very simple and type-safe. Still it is very flexible and powerful (see following features). The actual call of myMethod will technically call the remote service over the wire (e.g. via HTTP) including marshaling the arguments (e.g. converting myArgs to JSON) and unmarshalling the result (e.g. converting the received JSON to myResult).\nAsynchronous Invocation of void Methods\nIf you want to call a service method with void as return type, the type-safe call method can not be used as void methods do not return a result. Therefore you can use the callVoid method as following:\nprivate void callAsynchronousVoid(long id) {\nAsyncServiceClient&lt;MyService&gt; client = this.serviceClientFactory.createAsync(MyService.class);\n// call of service over the wire, will return when request is send and invoke resultHandler asynchronously\nConsumer&lt;Void&gt; resultHandler = r -&gt; { System.out.println(&quot;Response received&quot;)};\nclient.callVoid(() -&gt; { client.get().deleteEntity(id);}, resultHandler);\n}\nYou may also provide null as resultHandler for &quot;fire and forget&quot;. However, this will lead to the result being ignored so even in case of an error you will not be notified.\nConfiguration\nThis solution allows a very flexible configuration on the following levels:\nGlobal configuration (defaults)\nConfiguration per remote service application (microservice)\nConfiguration per invocation.\nA configuration on a deeper level (e.g. 3) overrides the configuration from a higher level (e.g. 1).\nThe configuration on Level 1 and 2 are configured via application.properties\n(see configuration guide).\nFor Level 1 the prefix service.client.default. is used for properties.\nFurther, for level 2. the prefix service.client.app.&#xAB;application&#xBB;. is used where &#xAB;application&#xBB; is the\ntechnical name of the application providing the service. This name will automatically be derived from\nthe java package of the service interface (e.g. foo in MyService interface before) following our\npackaging conventions.\nIn case these conventions are not met it will fallback to the fully qualified name of the service interface.\nConfiguration on Level 3 has to be provided as Map argument to the method\nServiceClientFactory.create(Class&lt;S&gt; serviceInterface, Map&lt;String, String&gt; config).\nThe keys of this Map will not use prefixes (such as the ones above). For common configuration\nparameters a type-safe builder is offered to create such map via ServiceClientConfigBuilder.\nE.g. for testing you may want to do:\nthis.serviceClientFactory.create(MyService.class,\nnew ServiceClientConfigBuilder().authBasic().userLogin(login).userPassword(password).buildMap());\nHere is an example of a configuration block for your application.properties:\nservice.client.default.url=https://api.company.com/services/${type}\nservice.client.default.timeout.connection=120\nservice.client.default.timeout.response=3600\nservice.client.app.bar.url=https://bar.company.com:8080/services/rest\nservice.client.app.bar.auth=basic\nservice.client.app.bar.user.login=user4711\nservice.client.app.bar.user.password=ENC(jd5ZREpBqxuN9ok0IhnXabgw7V3EoG2p)\nservice.client.app.foo.url=https://foo.company.com:8443/services/rest\n# authForward: simply forward Authorization header (e.g. with JWT) to remote service\nservice.client.app.bar.auth=authForward\nService Discovery\nYou do not want to hardwire service URLs in your code, right? Therefore different strategies might apply\nto discover the URL of the invoked service. This is done internally by an implementation of the interface\nServiceDiscoverer. The default implementation simply reads the base URL from the configuration.\nSo you can simply add this to your application.properties as in the above configuration example.\nAssuming your service interface would have the fully qualified name\ncom.company.department.foo.mycomponent.service.api.rest.MyService then the URL would be resolved to\nhttps://foo.company.com:8443/services/rest as the &#xAB;application&#xBB; is foo.\nAdditionally, the URL might use the following variables that will automatically be resolved:\n${app} to &#xAB;application&#xBB; (useful for default URL)\n${type} to the type of the service. E.g. rest in case of a REST service and ws for a SOAP service.\n${local.server.port} for the port of your current Java servlet container running the JVM. Should only used for testing with spring-boot random port mechanism (technically spring can not resolve this variable but we do it for you here).\nTherefore, the default URL may also be configured as:\nservice.client.default.url=https://api.company.com/${app}/services/${type}\nAs you can use any implementation of ServiceDiscoverer, you can also easily use eureka (or anything else) instead to discover your services.\nHowever, we recommend to use istio instead as described below.\nHeaders\nA very common demand is to tweak (HTTP) headers in the request to invoke the service. May it be for security (authentication data) or for other cross-cutting concerns (such as the Correlation ID). This is done internally by implementations of the interface ServiceHeaderCustomizer.\nWe already provide several implementations such as:\nServiceHeaderCustomizerBasicAuth for basic authentication (auth=basic).\nServiceHeaderCustomizerOAuth for OAuth: passes a security token from security context such as a JWT via OAuth (auth=oauth).\nServiceHeaderCustomizerAuthForward forwards the Authorization HTTP header from the running request to the request to the remote serivce as is (auth=authForward). Be careful to avoid security pitfals by misconfiguring this feature as it may also sensitive credentials (e.g. basic auth) to the remote service. Never use as default.\nServiceHeaderCustomizerCorrelationId passed the Correlation ID to the service request.\nAdditionally, you can add further custom implementations of ServiceHeaderCustomizer for your individual requirements and additional headers.\nTimeouts\nYou can configure timeouts in a very flexible way. First of all you can configure timeouts to establish the connection (timeout.connection) and to wait for the response (timeout.response) separately. These timeouts can be configured on all three levels as described in the configuration section above.\nError Handling\nWhilst invoking a remote service an error may occur. This solution will automatically handle such errors and map them to a higher level ServiceInvocationFailedException. In general we separate two different types of errors:\nNetwork error\nIn such case (host not found, connection refused, time out, etc.) there is not even a response from the server. However, in advance to a low-level exception you will get a wrapped ServiceInvocationFailedException (with code ServiceInvoke) with a readable message containing the service that could not be invoked.\nService error\nIn case the service failed on the server-side the error result will be parsed and thrown as a ServiceInvocationFailedException with the received message and code.\nThis allows to catch and handle errors when a service-invocation failed. You can even distinguish business errors from the server-side from technical errors and implement retry strategies or the like.\nFurther the created exception contains detailed contextual information about the serivce that failed (service interface class, method, URL) what makes it much easier to trace down errors. Here is an example from our tests:\nWhile invoking the service com.devonfw.test.app.myexample.service.api.rest.MyExampleRestService#businessError[http://localhost:50178/app/services/rest/my-example/v1/business-error] the following error occurred: Test of business error. Probably the service is temporary unavailable. Please try again later. If the problem persists contact your system administrator.\n2f43b03e-685b-45c0-9aae-23ff4b220c85:BusinessErrorCode\nYou may even provide your own implementation of ServiceClientErrorFactory instead to provide an own exception class for this purpose.\nHandling Erros\nIn case of a synchronous service invocation an error will be immediately thrown so you can sourround the call with a regular try-catch block:\nprivate void callSynchronous(MyArgs myArgs) {\nMyService myService = this.serviceClientFactory.create(MyService.class);\n// call of service over the wire, synchronously blocking until result is received or error occurred\ntry {\nMyResult myResult = myService.myMethod(myArgs);\nhandleResult(myResult);\n} catch (ServiceInvocationFailedException e) {\nif (e.isTechnical()) {\nhandleTechnicalError(e);\n} else {\n// error code you defined in the exception on the server side of the service\nString errorCode = e.getCode();\nhandleBusinessError(e, errorCode;\n}\n} catch (Throwable e) { // you may not handle this explicitly here...\nhandleTechnicalError(e);\n}\n}\nIf you are using asynchronous service invocation an error can occurr in a separate thread. Therefore you may and should define a custom error handler:\nprivate void callAsynchronous(MyArgs myArgs) {\nAsyncServiceClient&lt;MyService&gt; client = this.serviceClientFactory.createAsync(MyService.class);\nConsumer&lt;Throwalbe&gt; errorHandler = this::handleError;\nclient.setErrorHandler(errorHandler);\n// call of service over the wire, will return when request is send and invoke handleResult asynchronously\nclient.call(client.get().myMethod(myArgs), this::handleResult);\n}\nprivate void handleError(Throwalbe error) {\n...\n}\n}\nThe error handler consumes Throwable and not only RuntimeException so you can get notified even in case of an unexpected OutOfMemoryError, NoClassDefFoundError, or other technical problems. Please note that the error handler may also be called from the thread calling the service (e.g. if already creating the request fails). The default error handler used if no custom handler is set will only log the error and do nothing else.\nLogging\nBy default this solution will log all invocations including the URL of the invoked service, success or error status flag and the duration in seconds (with decimal nano precision as available). Therefore you can easily monitor the status and performance of the service invocations. Here is an example from our tests:\nInvoking service com.devonfw.test.app.myexample.service.api.rest.MyExampleRestService#greet[http://localhost:50178/app/services/rest/my-example/v1/greet/John%20Doe%20%26%20%3F%23] took PT20.309756622S (20309756622ns) and succeded with status 200.\nResilience\nResilience adds a lot of complexity and that typically means that addressing this here would most probably result in not being up-to-date and not meeting all requirements. Therefore we recommend something completely different: the sidecar approach (based on sidecar pattern). This means that you use a generic proxy app that runs as a separate process on the same host, VM, or container of your actual application. Then in your app you are calling the service via the sidecar proxy on localhost (service discovery URL is e.g. http://localhost:8081/${app}/services/${type}) that then acts as proxy to the actual remote service. Now aspects such as resilience with circuit breaking and the actual service discovery can be configured in the sidecar proxy app and independent of your actual application. Therefore, you can even share and reuse configuration and experience with such a sidecar proxy app even across different technologies (Java, .NET/C#, Node.JS, etc.). Further, you do not pollute the technology stack of your actual app with the infrastructure for resilience, throttling, etc. and can update the app and the side-card independently when security-fixes are available.\nVarious implementations of such sidecar proxy apps are available as free open source software.\nOur recommendation in devonfw is to use istio. This not only provides such a side-car but also an entire management solution for service-mesh making administration and maintenance much easier. Platforms like OpenShift support this out of the box.\nHowever, if you are looking for details about side-car implementations for services you can have a look at the following links:\nNetflix Sidecar - see Spring Cloud Netflix docs\nEnvoy - see Microservices Patterns With Envoy Sidecar Proxy\nPrana - see Prana: A Sidecar for your Netflix PaaS based Applications and Services &#x2190; Not updated as it&#x2019;s not used internally by Netflix\nKeycloak - see Protecting Jaeger UI with a sidecar security proxy\n"},{"id":158,"path":"../..\\..\\..\\..\\..\\xampp\\htdocs\\devonfw.github.io\\website\\pages\\docs/devon4j.asciidoc_guides.html#guide-testing.asciidoc","type":"docs","title":"Testing","body":"12.23.

May declare data in a POJO style to be used as boiler plate code to parameter lists or even influence the control flow towards the test&#x2019;s needs.\nFake objects actually have working implementations, but usually take some shortcut which makes them not suitable for production (an in memory database is a good example).\nStubs provide canned answers to calls made during the test, usually not responding at all to anything outside what&#x2019;s programmed in for the test. Stubs may also record information about calls, such as an email gateway stub that remembers the messages it &apos;sent&apos;, or maybe only how many messages it &apos;sent&apos;.\nMocks are objects pre-programmed with expectations, which form a specification of the calls they are expected to receive.\nWe try to give some examples, which should make it somehow clearer:\nStubs\nBest Practices for applications:\nA good way to replace small to medium large boundary systems, whose impact (e.g. latency) should be ignored during load and performance tests of the application under development.\nAs stub implementation will rely on state-based verification, there is the threat, that test developers will partially reimplement the state transitions based on the replaced code. This will immediately lead to a black maintenance whole, so better use mocks to assure the certain behavior on interface level.\nDo NOT use stubs as basis of a large amount of test cases as due to state-based verification of stubs, test developers will enrich the stub implementation to become a large monster with its own hunger after maintenance efforts.\nMocks\nBest Practices for applications:\nReplace not-needed dependencies of your system-under-test (SUT) to minimize the application context to start of your component framework.\nReplace dependencies of your SUT to impact the control flow under test without establishing all the context parameters needed to match the control flow.\nRemember: Not everything has to be mocked! Especially on lower levels of tests like isolated module tests you can be betrayed into a mocking delusion, where you end up in a hundred lines of code mocking the whole context and five lines executing the test and verifying the mocks behavior.

The mocked server can be configured to respond to specific requests in a given way via a fluent Java API, JSON files and JSON over HTTP. An example as an integration to JUnit can look as follows.\nimport static com.github.tomakehurst.wiremock.core.WireMockConfiguration.wireMockConfig;\nimport com.github.tomakehurst.wiremock.junit.WireMockRule;\npublic class WireMockOfferImport{\n@Rule\npublic WireMockRule mockServer = new WireMockRule(wireMockConfig().dynamicPort());\n@Test\npublic void requestDataTest() throws Exception {\nint port = this.mockServer.port();\n...}\nThis creates a server on a randomly chosen free port on the running machine. You can also specify the port to be used if wanted. Other than that there are several options to further configure the server. This includes HTTPs, proxy settings, file locations, logging and extensions.\n@Test\npublic void requestDataTest() throws Exception {\nthis.mockServer.stubFor(get(urlEqualTo(&quot;/new/offers&quot;)).withHeader(&quot;Accept&quot;, equalTo(&quot;application/json&quot;))\n.withHeader(&quot;Authorization&quot;, containing(&quot;Basic&quot;)).willReturn(aResponse().withStatus(200).withFixedDelay(1000)\n.withHeader(&quot;Content-Type&quot;, &quot;application/json&quot;).withBodyFile(&quot;/wireMockTest/jsonBodyFile.json&quot;)));\n}\nThis will stub the URL localhost:port/new/offers to respond with a status 200 message containing a header (Content-Type: application/json) and a body with content given in jsonBodyFile.json if the request matches several conditions.\nIt has to be a GET request to ../new/offers with the two given header properties.\nNote that by default files are located in src/test/resources/__files/. When using only one WireMock server one can omit the this.mockServer in before the stubFor call (static method).\nYou can also add a fixed delay to the response or processing delay with WireMock.addRequestProcessingDelay(time) in order to test for timeouts.\nWireMock can also respond with different corrupted messages to simulate faulty behaviour.\n@Test(expected = ResourceAccessException.class)\npublic void faultTest() {\nthis.mockServer.stubFor(get(urlEqualTo(&quot;/fault&quot;)).willReturn(aResponse()\n.withFault(Fault.MALFORMED_RESPONSE_CHUNK)));\n...}\nA GET request to ../fault returns an OK status header, then garbage, and then closes the connection.\n"},{"id":162,"path":"../..\\..\\..\\..\\..\\xampp\\htdocs\\devonfw.github.io\\website\\pages\\docs/devon4j.asciidoc_guides.html#guide-testing.asciidoc_integration-levels","type":"docs","title":"Integration Levels","body":"12.23.4. Integration Levels\nThere are many discussions about the right level of integration for test automation. Sometimes it is better to focus on small, isolated modules of the system - whatever a &quot;module&quot; may be. In other cases it makes more sense to test integrated groups of modules. Because there is no universal answer to this question, devonfw only defines a common terminology for what could be tested. Each project must make its own decision where to put the focus of test automation. There is no worldwide accepted terminology for the integration levels of testing. In general we consider ISTQB. However, with a technical focus on test automation we want to get more precise.\nThe following picture shows a simplified view of an application based on the devonfw reference architecture. We define four integration levels that are explained in detail below.\nThe boxes in the picture contain parenthesized numbers. These numbers depict the lowest integration level, a box belongs to. Higher integration levels also contain all boxes of lower integration levels. When writing tests for a given integration level, related boxes with a lower integration level must be replaced by test doubles or drivers.\nThe main difference between the integration levels is the amount of infrastructure needed to test them. The more infrastructure you need, the more bugs you will find, but the more instable and the slower your tests will be. So each project has to make a trade-off between pros and contras of including much infrastructure in tests and has to select the integration levels that fit best to the project.\nConsider, that more infrastructure does not automatically lead to a better bug-detection. There may be bugs in your software that are masked by bugs in the infrastructure. The best way to find those bugs is to test with very few infrastructure.\nExternal systems do not belong to any of the integration levels defined here. devonfw does not recommend involving real external systems in test automation. This means, they have to be replaced by test doubles in automated tests. An exception may be external systems that are fully under control of the own development team.\nThe following chapters describe the four integration levels.\nLevel 1 Module Test\nThe goal of a isolated module test is to provide fast feedback to the developer. Consequently, isolated module tests must not have any interaction with the client, the database, the file system, the network, etc.\nAn isolated module test is testing a single classes or at least a small set of classes in isolation. If such classes depend on other components or external resources, etc. these shall be replaced with a test double.\npublic class MyClassTest extends ModuleTest {\n@Test\npublic void testMyClass() {\n// given\nMyClass myClass = new MyClass();\n// when\nString value = myClass.doSomething();\n// then\nassertThat(value).isEqualTo(&quot;expected value&quot;);\n}\n}\nFor an advanced example see here.\nLevel 2 Component Test\nA component test aims to test components or component parts as a unit.\nThese tests typically run with a (light-weight) infrastructure such as spring-boot-starter-test and can access resources such as a database (e.g. for DAO tests).\nFurther, no remote communication is intended here. Access to external systems shall be replaced by a test double.\nWith devon4j and spring you can write a component-test as easy as illustrated in the following example:\n@SpringBootTest(classes = { MySpringBootApp.class }, webEnvironment = WebEnvironment.NONE)\npublic class UcFindCountryTest extends ComponentTest {\n@Inject\nprivate UcFindCountry ucFindCountry;\n@Test\npublic void testFindCountry() {\n// given\nString countryCode = &quot;de&quot;;\n// when\nTestUtil.login(&quot;user&quot;, MyAccessControlConfig.FIND_COUNTRY);\nCountryEto country = this.ucFindCountry.findCountry(countryCode);\n// then\nassertThat(country).isNotNull();\nassertThat(country.getCountryCode()).isEqualTo(countryCode);\nassertThat(country.getName()).isEqualTo(&quot;Germany&quot;);\n}\n}\nThis test will start the entire spring-context of your app (MySpringBootApp). Within the test spring will inject according spring-beans into all your fields annotated with @Inject. In the test methods you can use these spring-beans and perform your actual tests. This pattern can be used for testing DAOs/Repositories, Use-Cases, or any other spring-bean with its entire configuration including database and transactions.\nWhen you are testing use-cases your authorization will also be in place. Therefore, you have to simulate a logon in advance what is done via the login method in the above example. The test-infrastructure will automatically do a logout for you after each test method in doTearDown.\nLevel 3 Subsystem Test\nA subsystem test runs against the external interfaces (e.g. HTTP service) of the integrated subsystem. Subsystem tests of the client subsystem are described in the devon4ng testing guide. In devon4j the server (JEE application) is the subsystem under test. The tests act as a client (e.g. service consumer) and the server has to be integrated and started in a container.\nWith devon4j and spring you can write a subsystem-test as easy as illustrated in the following example:\n@SpringBootTest(classes = { MySpringBootApp.class }, webEnvironment = WebEnvironment.RANDOM_PORT)\npublic class CountryRestServiceTest extends SubsystemTest {\n@Inject\nprivate ServiceClientFactory serviceClientFactory;\n@Test\npublic void testFindCountry() {\n// given\nString countryCode = &quot;de&quot;;\n// when\nCountryRestService service = this.serviceClientFactory.create(CountryRestService.class);\nCountryEto country = service.findCountry(countryCode);\n// then\nassertThat(country).isNotNull();\nassertThat(country.getCountryCode()).isEqualTo(countryCode);\nassertThat(country.getName()).isEqualTo(&quot;Germany&quot;);\n}\n}\nEven though not obvious on the first look this test will start your entire application as a server on a free random port (so that it works in CI with parallel builds for different branches) and tests the invocation of a (REST) service including (un)marshalling of data (e.g. as JSON) and transport via HTTP (all in the invocation of the findCountry method).\nDo not confuse a subsystem test with a system integration test. A system integration test validates the interaction of several systems where we do not recommend test automation.\nLevel 4 System Test\nA system test has the goal to test the system as a whole against its official interfaces such as its UI or batches. The system itself runs as a separate process in a way close to a regular deployment. Only external systems are simulated by test doubles.\nThe devonfw only gives advice for automated system test (TODO see allure testing framework). In nearly every project there must be manual system tests, too. This manual system tests are out of scope here.\nClassifying Integration-Levels\ndevon4j defines Category-Interfaces that shall be used as JUnit Categories.\nAlso devon4j provides abstract base classes that you may extend in your test-cases if you like.\ndevon4j further pre-configures the maven build to only run integration levels 1-2 by default (e.g. for fast feedback in continuous integration). It offers the profiles subsystemtest (1-3) and systemtest (1-4). In your nightly build you can simply add -Psystemtest to run all tests.\n"},{"id":163,"path":"../..\\..\\..\\..\\..\\xampp\\htdocs\\devonfw.github.io\\website\\pages\\docs/devon4j.asciidoc_guides.html#guide-testing.asciidoc_implementation","type":"docs","title":"Implementation","body":"12.23.5. Implementation\nThis section introduces how to implement tests on the different levels with the given devonfw infrastructure and the proposed frameworks.\nModule Test\nIn devon4j you can extend the abstract class ModuleTest to basically get access to assertions. In order to test classes embedded in dependencies and external services one needs to provide mocks for that. As the technology stack recommends we use the Mockito framework to offer this functionality. The following example shows how to implement Mockito into a JUnit test.\nimport static org.mockito.Mockito.when;\nimport static org.mockito.Mockito.mock;\n...\npublic class StaffmanagementImplTest extends ModuleTest {\n@Rule\npublic MockitoRule rule = MockitoJUnit.rule();\n@Test\npublic void testFindStaffMember() {\n...}\n}\nNote that the test class does not use the @SpringApplicationConfiguration annotation. In a module test one does not use the whole application.\nThe JUnit rule is the best solution to use in order to get all needed functionality of Mockito. Static imports are a convenient option to enhance readability within Mockito tests.\nYou can define mocks with the @Mock annotation or the mock(*.class) call. To inject the mocked objects into your class under test you can use the @InjectMocks annotation. This automatically uses the setters of StaffmanagementImpl to inject the defined mocks into the class under test (CUT) when there is a setter available. In this case the beanMapper and the staffMemberDao are injected. Of course it is possible to do this manually if you need more control.\n@Mock\nprivate BeanMapper beanMapper;\n@Mock\nprivate StaffMemberEntity staffMemberEntity;\n@Mock\nprivate StaffMemberEto staffMemberEto;\n@Mock\nprivate StaffMemberDao staffMemberDao;\n@InjectMocks\nStaffmanagementImpl staffmanagementImpl = new StaffmanagementImpl();\nThe mocked objects do not provide any functionality at the time being. To define what happens on a method call on a mocked dependency in the CUT one can use when(condition).thenReturn(result). In this case we want to test findStaffMember(Long id) in the StaffmanagementImpl.\npublic StaffMemberEto findStaffMember(Long id) {\nreturn getBeanMapper().map(getStaffMemberDao().find(id), StaffMemberEto.class);\n}\nIn this simple example one has to stub two calls on the CUT as you can see below. For example the method call of the CUT staffMemberDao.find(id) is stubbed for returning a mock object staffMemberEntity that is also defined as mock.\nSubsystem Test\ndevon4j provides a simple test infrastructure to aid with the implementation of subsystem tests. It becomes available by simply subclassing AbstractRestServiceTest.java.\n//given\nlong id = 1L;\nClass&lt;StaffMemberEto&gt; targetClass = StaffMemberEto.class;\nwhen(this.staffMemberDao.find(id)).thenReturn(this.staffMemberEntity);\nwhen(this.beanMapper.map(this.staffMemberEntity, targetClass)).thenReturn(this.staffMemberEto);\n//when\nStaffMemberEto resultEto = this.staffmanagementImpl.findStaffMember(id);\n//then\nassertThat(resultEto).isNotNull();\nassertThat(resultEto).isEqualTo(this.staffMemberEto);\nAfter the test method call one can verify the expected results. Mockito can check whether a mocked method call was indeed called. This can be done using Mockito verify. Note that it does not generate any value if you check for method calls that are needed to reach the asserted result anyway. Call verification can be useful e.g. when you want to assure that statistics are written out without actually testing them.\n"},{"id":164,"path":"../..\\..\\..\\..\\..\\xampp\\htdocs\\devonfw.github.io\\website\\pages\\docs/devon4j.asciidoc_guides.html#guide-testing.asciidoc_regression-testing","type":"docs","title":"Regression testing","body":"12.23.6.

Deployment Pipeline\nA deployment pipeline is a semi-automated process that gets software-changes from version control into production. It contains several validation steps, e.g. automated tests of all integration levels.\nBecause devon4j should fit to different project types - from agile to waterfall - it does not define a standard deployment pipeline. But we recommend to define such a deployment pipeline explicitly for each project and to find the right place in it for each type of test.\nFor that purpose, it is advisable to have fast running test suite that gives as much confidence as possible without needing too much time and too much infrastructure. This test suite should run in an early stage of your deployment pipeline. Maybe the developer should run it even before he/she checked in the code. Usually lower integration levels are more suitable for this test suite than higher integration levels.\nNote, that the deployment pipeline always should contain manual validation steps, at least manual acceptance testing. There also may be manual validation steps that have to be executed for special changes only, e.g. usability testing. Management and execution processes of those manual validation steps are currently not in the scope of devonfw.\n"},{"id":166,"path":"../..\\..\\..\\..\\..\\xampp\\htdocs\\devonfw.github.io\\website\\pages\\docs/devon4j.asciidoc_guides.html#guide-testing.asciidoc_test-coverage","type":"docs","title":"Test Coverage","body":"12.23.8.

Test Configuration\nThis section covers test configuration in general without focusing on integration levels as in the first chapter.\nConfigure Test Specific Beans\nSometimes it can become handy to provide other or differently configured bean implementations via CDI than those available in production. For example, when creating beans using @Bean-annotated methods they are usually configured within those methods. WebSecurityBeansConfig shows an example of such methods.\n@Configuration\npublic class WebSecurityBeansConfig {\n//...\n@Bean\npublic AccessControlSchemaProvider accessControlSchemaProvider() {\n// actually no additional configuration is shown here\nreturn new AccessControlSchemaProviderImpl();\n}\n//...\n}\nAccessControlSchemaProvider allows to programmatically access data defined in some XML file, e.g. access-control-schema.xml. Now, one can imagine that it would be helpful if AccessControlSchemaProvider would point to some other file than the default within a test class. That file could provide content that differs from the default.\nThe question is: how can I change resource path of AccessControlSchemaProviderImpl within a test?\nOne very helpful solution is to use static inner classes.\nStatic inner classes can contain @Bean -annotated methods, and by placing them in the classes parameter in @SpringBootTest(classes = { /* place class here*/ }) annotation the beans returned by these methods are placed in the application context during test execution. Combining this feature with inheritance allows to override methods defined in other configuration classes as shown in the following listing where TempWebSecurityConfig extends WebSecurityBeansConfig. This relationship allows to override public AccessControlSchemaProvider accessControlSchemaProvider(). Here we are able to configure the instance of type AccessControlSchemaProviderImpl before returning it (and, of course, we could also have used a completely different implementation of the AccessControlSchemaProvider interface). By overriding the method the implementation of the super class is ignored, hence, only the new implementation is called at runtime. Other methods defined in WebSecurityBeansConfig which are not overridden by the subclass are still dispatched to WebSecurityBeansConfig.\n//... Other testing related annotations\n@SpringBootTest(classes = { TempWebSecurityConfig.class })\npublic class SomeTestClass {\npublic static class TempWebSecurityConfig extends WebSecurityBeansConfig {\n@Override\n@Bean\npublic AccessControlSchemaProvider accessControlSchemaProvider() {\nClassPathResource resource = new ClassPathResource(locationPrefix + &quot;access-control-schema3.xml&quot;);\nAccessControlSchemaProviderImpl accessControlSchemaProvider = new AccessControlSchemaProviderImpl();\naccessControlSchemaProvider.setAccessControlSchema(resource);\nreturn accessControlSchemaProvider;\n}\n}\n}\nThe following chapter of the Spring framework documentation explains issue, but uses a slightly different way to obtain the configuration.\nTest Data\nIt is possible to obtain test data in two different ways depending on your test&#x2019;s integration level.\n"},{"id":168,"path":"../..\\..\\..\\..\\..\\xampp\\htdocs\\devonfw.github.io\\website\\pages\\docs/devon4j.asciidoc_guides.html#guide-testing.asciidoc_debugging-tests","type":"docs","title":"Debugging Tests","body":"12.23.10. Debugging Tests\nThe following two sections describe two debugging approaches for tests. Tests are either run from within the IDE or from the command line using Maven.\nDebugging with the IDE\nDebugging with the IDE is as easy as always. Even if you want to execute a SubsystemTest which needs a Spring context and a server infrastructure to run properly, you just set your breakpoints and click on Debug As &#x2192; JUnit Test. The test infrastructure will take care of initializing the necessary infrastructure - if everything is configured properly.\nDebugging with Maven\nPlease refer to the following two links to find a guide for debugging tests when running them from Maven.\nhttp://maven.apache.org/surefire/maven-surefire-plugin/examples/debugging.html\nhttps://www.eclipse.org/jetty/documentation/9.3.x/debugging-with-eclipse.html\nIn essence, you first have to start execute a test using the command line. Maven will halt just before the test execution and wait for your IDE to connect to the process. When receiving a connection the test will start and then pause at any breakpoint set in advance.\nThe first link states that tests are started through the following command:\nmvn -Dmaven.surefire.debug test\nAlthough this is correct, it will run every test class in your project and - which is time consuming and mostly unnecessary - halt before each of these tests.\nTo counter this problem you can simply execute a single test class through the following command (here we execute the TablemanagementRestServiceTest from the restaurant sample application):\nmvn test -Dmaven.surefire.debug test -Dtest=TablemanagementRestServiceTest\nIt is important to notice that you first have to execute the Maven command in the according submodule, e.g. to execute the TablemanagementRestServiceTest you have first to navigate to the core module&#x2019;s directory.\n"},{"id":169,"path":"../..\\..\\..\\..\\..\\xampp\\htdocs\\devonfw.github.io\\website\\pages\\docs/devon4j.asciidoc_guides.html#guide-transferobject.asciidoc","type":"docs","title":"Transfer-Objects","body":"12.24.

Therefore a structured data model should make use of custom datatypes in order to be expressive.\nCommon generic datatypes are String, Boolean, Number and its subclasses, Currency, etc.\nPlease note that both Date and Calendar are mutable and have very confusing APIs. Therefore, use JSR-310 or jodatime instead.\nEven if a datatype is technically nothing but a String or a Number but logically something special it is worth to define it as a dedicated datatype class already for the purpose of having a central javadoc to explain it. On the other side avoid to introduce technical datatypes like String32 for a String with a maximum length of 32 characters as this is not adding value in the sense of a real Datatype.\nIt is suitable and in most cases also recommended to use the class implementing the datatype as API omitting a dedicated interface.\n&#x2014; mmm project\ndatatype javadoc\nSee mmm datatype javadoc.\n"},{"id":181,"path":"../..\\..\\..\\..\\..\\xampp\\htdocs\\devonfw.github.io\\website\\pages\\docs/devon4j.asciidoc_guides.html#guide-datatype.asciidoc_datatype-packaging","type":"docs","title":"Datatype Packaging","body":"12.26.1.

However, instead of using ResourceBundleProvider and refactoring your entire code causing incompatibilities, you can simply put the resource bundles in a regular JAR on the classpath rather than a named module (or into the lauching app).\nIf you want to implement (new) Java modules with i18n support, you can have a look at mmm-nls.\nBuildtime Changes\nIf you also want to change your build to work with a recent JDK you also need to ensure that test frameworks and maven plugins properly support this.\nFindbugs\nFindbugs does not work with Java 9+ and is actually a dead project.\nThe new findbugs is SpotBugs.\nFor maven the new solution is spotbugs-maven-plugin:\n&lt;plugin&gt;\n&lt;groupId&gt;com.github.spotbugs&lt;/groupId&gt;\n&lt;artifactId&gt;spotbugs-maven-plugin&lt;/artifactId&gt;\n&lt;version&gt;3.1.11&lt;/version&gt;\n&lt;/plugin&gt;\nTest Frameworks\nTable 39.

Microservices in devonfw\nThe Microservices architecture is an approach for application development based on a series of small services grouped under a business domain. Each individual service runs autonomously and communicating with each other through their APIs. That independence between the different services allows to manage (upgrade, fix, deploy, etc.) each one without affecting the rest of the system&#x2019;s services. In addition to that the microservices architecture allows to scale specific services when facing an increment of the requests, so the applications based on microservices are more flexible and stable, and can be adapted quickly to demand changes.\nHowever, this new approach, developing apps based on microservices, presents some downsides.\nLet&#x2019;s see the main challenges when working with microservices:\nHaving the applications divided in different services we will need a component (router) to redirect each request to the related microservice. These redirection rules must implement filters to guarantee a proper functionality.\nIn order to manage correctly the routing process, the application will also need a catalog with all the microservices and its details: IPs and ports of each of the deployed instances of each microservice, the state of each instance and some other related information. This catalog is called Service Discovery.\nWith all the information of the Service Discovery the application will need to calculate and select between all the available instances of a microservice which is the suitable one. This will be figured out by the library Client Side Load Balancer.\nThe different microservices will be likely interconnected with each other, that means that in case of failure of one of the microservices involved in a process, the application must implement a mechanism to avoid the error propagation through the rest of the services and provide an alternative as a process result. To solve this, the pattern Circuit Breaker can be implemented in the calls between microservices.\nAs we have mentioned, the microservices will exchange calls and information with each other so our applications will need to provide a secured context to avoid not allowed operations or intrusions. In addition, since microservices must be able to operate in an isolated way, it is not recommended to maintain a session. To meet this need without using Spring sessions, a token-based authentication is used that exchanges information using the json web token (JWT) protocol.\nIn addition to all of this we will find other issues related to this particular architecture that we will address fitting the requirements of each project.\nDistributed data bases: each instance of a microservice should have only one data base.\nCentralized logs: each instance of a microservice creates a log and a trace that should be centralized to allow an easier way to read all that information.\nCentralized configuration: each microservice has its own configuration, so our applications should group all those configurations in only one place to ease the configuration management.\nAutomatized deployments: as we are managing several components (microservices, catalogs, balancers, etc.) the deployment should be automatized to avoid errors and ease this process.\nTo address the above, devonfw microservices has an alternative approach Microservices based on Netflix-Tools.\n"},{"id":194,"path":"../..\\..\\..\\..\\..\\xampp\\htdocs\\devonfw.github.io\\website\\pages\\docs/devon4j.asciidoc_guides.html#guide-apm.asciidoc","type":"docs","title":"Application Performance Management","body":"12.31.

Implementation with the devonfw\nTo use Feature-Toggles with the devonfw, use the Framework Togglz because it has all the features generally needed and provides a great documentation.\nFor a pretty minimal working example, also see this fork.\nPreparation\nThe following example takes place in the oasp-sample-core project, so the necessary dependencies have to be added to the according pom.xml file. Required are the main Togglz project including Spring support, the Togglz console to graphically change the feature state and the Spring security package to handle authentication for the Togglz console.\n&lt;!-- Feature-Toggle-Framework togglz --&gt;\n&lt;dependency&gt;\n&lt;groupId&gt;org.togglz&lt;/groupId&gt;\n&lt;artifactId&gt;togglz-spring-boot-starter&lt;/artifactId&gt;\n&lt;version&gt;2.3.0.RC2&lt;/version&gt;\n&lt;/dependency&gt;\n&lt;dependency&gt;\n&lt;groupId&gt;org.togglz&lt;/groupId&gt;\n&lt;artifactId&gt;togglz-console&lt;/artifactId&gt;\n&lt;version&gt;2.3.0.RC2&lt;/version&gt;\n&lt;/dependency&gt;\n&lt;dependency&gt;\n&lt;groupId&gt;org.togglz&lt;/groupId&gt;\n&lt;artifactId&gt;togglz-spring-security&lt;/artifactId&gt;\n&lt;version&gt;2.3.0.RC2&lt;/version&gt;\n&lt;/dependency&gt;\nIn addition to that, the following lines have to be included in the spring configuration file application.properties\n# configuration for the togglz Feature-Toggle-Framework\ntogglz.enabled=true\ntogglz.console.secured=false\nSmall features\nFor small features, a simple query of the toggle state is often enough to achieve the desired functionality. To illustrate this, a simple example follows, which implements a toggle to limit the page size returned by the staffmanagement. See here for further details.\nThis is the current implementation to toggle the feature:\n// Uncomment next line in order to limit the maximum page size for the staff member search\n// criteria.limitMaximumPageSize(MAXIMUM_HIT_LIMIT);\nTo realise this more elegantly with Togglz, first an enum is required to configure the feature-toggle.\npublic enum StaffmanagementFeatures implements Feature {\n@Label(&quot;Limit the maximum page size for the staff members&quot;)\nLIMIT_STAFF_PAGE_SIZE;\npublic boolean isActive() {\nreturn FeatureContext.getFeatureManager().isActive(this);\n}\n}\nTo familiarize the Spring framework with the enum, add the following entry to the application.properties file.\ntogglz.feature-enums=io.oasp.gastronomy.restaurant.staffmanagement.featuremanager.StaffmanagementFeatures\nAfter that, the toggle can be used easily by calling the isActive() method of the enum.\nif (StaffmanagementFeatures.LIMIT_STAFF_PAGE_SIZE.isActive()) {\ncriteria.limitMaximumPageSize(MAXIMUM_HIT_LIMIT);\n}\nThis way, you can easily switch the feature on or off by using the administration console at http://localhost:8081/devon4j-sample-server/togglz-console.

The following example is an implementation of a feature which adds a 25% discount to all products managed by the offermanagement.\nTherefore there are two strategies needed:\nReturn the offers with the normal price\nReturn the offers with a 25% discount\nThe implementation is pretty straight forward so use this as a reference. Compare this for further details.\n@Override\n@RolesAllowed(PermissionConstants.FIND_OFFER)\npublic PaginatedListTo&lt;OfferEto&gt; findOfferEtos(OfferSearchCriteriaTo criteria) {\ncriteria.limitMaximumPageSize(MAXIMUM_HIT_LIMIT);\nPaginatedListTo&lt;OfferEntity&gt; offers = getOfferDao().findOffers(criteria);\nif (OffermanagementFeatures.DISCOUNT.isActive()) {\nreturn getOfferEtosDiscount(offers);\n} else {\nreturn getOfferEtosNormalPrice(offers);\n}\n}\n// Strategy 1: Return the OfferEtos with the normal price\nprivate PaginatedListTo&lt;OfferEto&gt; getOfferEtosNormalPrice(PaginatedListTo&lt;OfferEntity&gt; offers) {\nreturn mapPaginatedEntityList(offers, OfferEto.class);\n}\n// Strategy 2: Return the OfferEtos with the new, discounted price\nprivate PaginatedListTo&lt;OfferEto&gt; getOfferEtosDiscount(PaginatedListTo&lt;OfferEntity&gt; offers) {\noffers = addDiscountToOffers(offers);\nreturn mapPaginatedEntityList(offers, OfferEto.class);\n}\nprivate PaginatedListTo&lt;OfferEntity&gt; addDiscountToOffers(PaginatedListTo&lt;OfferEntity&gt; offers) {\nfor (OfferEntity oe : offers.getResult()) {\nDouble oldPrice = oe.getPrice().getValue().doubleValue();\n// calculate the new price and round it to two decimal places\nBigDecimal newPrice = new BigDecimal(oldPrice * 0.75);\nnewPrice = newPrice.setScale(2, RoundingMode.HALF_UP);\noe.setPrice(new Money(newPrice));\n}\nreturn offers;\n}\n"},{"id":205,"path":"../..\\..\\..\\..\\..\\xampp\\htdocs\\devonfw.github.io\\website\\pages\\docs/devon4j.asciidoc_guides.html#guide-feature-toggle.asciidoc_guidelines-for-a-successful-use-of-feature-toggles","type":"docs","title":"Guidelines for a successful use of feature-toggles","body":"12.33.2. Guidelines for a successful use of feature-toggles\nThe use of feature-toggles requires a specified set of guidelines to maintain the overview on the software. The following is a collection of considerations and examples for conventions that are reasonable to use.\nMinimize the number of toggles\nWhen using too many toggles at the same time, it is hard to maintain a good overview of the system and things like finding bugs are getting much harder. Additionally, the management of toggles in the configuration interface gets more difficult due to the amount of toggles.\nTo prevent toggles from piling up during development, a toggle and the associated obsolete source code should be removed after the completion of the corresponding feature. In addition to that, the existing toggles should be revisited periodically to verify that these are still needed and therefore remove legacy toggles.\nConsistent naming scheme\nA consistent naming scheme is the key to a structured and easily maintainable set of features. This should include the naming of toggles in the source code and the appropriate naming of commit messages in the VCS. The following section contains an example for a useful naming scheme including a small example.\nEvery Feature-Toggle in the system has to get its own unique name without repeating any names of features, which were removed from the system. The chosen names should be descriptive names to simplify the association between toggles and their purpose. If the feature should be split into multiple sub-features, you might want to name the feature like the parent feature with a describing addition. If for example you want to split the DISCOUNT feature into the logic and the UI part, you might want to name the sub-features DISCOUNT_LOGIC and DISCOUNT_UI.\nThe entry in the togglz configuration enum should be named identically to the aforementioned feature name. The explicitness of feature names prevents a confusion between toggles due to using multiple enums.\nCommit messages are very important for the use of feature-toggles and also should follow a predefined naming scheme. You might want to state the feature name at the beginning of the message, followed by the actual message, describing what the commit changes to the feature. An example commit message could look like the following:\nDISCOUNT: Add the feature-toggle to the offermanagement implementation.\nMentioning the feature name in the commit message has the advantage, that you can search your git log for the feature name and get every commit belonging to the feature. An example for this using the tool grep could look like this.\n$ git log | grep -C 4 DISCOUNT\ncommit 034669a48208cb946cc6ba8a258bdab586929dd9\nAuthor: Florian Luediger &lt;florian.luediger@somemail.com&gt;\nDate: Thu Jul 7 13:04:37 2016 +0100\nDISCOUNT: Add the feature-toggle to the offermanagement implementation.\nTo keep track of all the features in your software system, a platform like GitHub offers issues. When creating an issue for every feature, you can retrace, who created the feature and who is assigned to completing its development. When referencing the issue from commits, you also have links to all the relevant commits from the issue view.\nPlacement of toggle points\nTo maintain a clean codebase, you definitely want to avoid using the same toggle in different places in the software. There should be one single query of the toggle which should be able to toggle the whole functionality of the feature. If one single toggle point is not enough to switch the whole feature on or off, you might want to think about splitting the feature into multiple ones.\nUse of fine-grained features\nBigger features in general should be split into multiple sub-features to maintain the overview on the codebase. These sub-features get their own feature-toggle and get implemented independently.\n"},{"id":206,"path":"../..\\..\\..\\..\\..\\xampp\\htdocs\\devonfw.github.io\\website\\pages\\docs/devon4j.asciidoc_guides.html#guide-accessibility.asciidoc","type":"docs","title":"Accessibility","body":"12.34.

JEE\nThis section is about Java Enterprise Edition (JEE). Regarding to our key principles we focus on open standards. For Java this means that we consider official standards from Java Standard and Enterprise Edition as first choice for considerations. Therefore we also decided to recommend JAX-RS over SpringMVC as the latter is proprietary. Only if an existing Java standard is not suitable for current demands such as Java Server Faces (JSF), we do not officially recommend it (while you are still free to use it if you have good reasons to do so). In all other cases we officially suggest the according standard and use it in our guides, code-samples, sample application, modules, templates, etc. Examples for such standards are JPA, JAX-RS, JAX-WS, JSR330, JSR250, JAX-B, etc.\n"},{"id":208,"path":"../..\\..\\..\\..\\..\\xampp\\htdocs\\devonfw.github.io\\website\\pages\\docs/devon4j.asciidoc_guides.html#guide-jee.asciidoc_application-server","type":"docs","title":"Application-Server","body":"12.35.1. Application-Server\nWe designed everything based on standards to work with different technology stacks and servlet containers. However, we strongly encourage to use spring and spring-boot. You are free to decide for something else but here is a list of good reasons for our decision:\nUp-to-date\nWith spring you easily keep up to date with evolving technologies (microservices, reactive, NoSQL, etc.). Most application servers put you in a jail with old legacy technology. In many cases you are even forced to use a totally outdated version of java (JVM/JDK). This may even cause severe IT-Security vulnerabilities but with expensive support you might get updates. Also with spring and open-source you need to be aware that for IT-security you need to update recently what can cost quite a lot of additional maintenance effort.\nDevelopment speed\nWith spring-boot you can implement and especially test your individual logic very fast. Starting the app in your IDE is very easy, fast, and realistic (close to production). You can easily write JUnit tests that startup your server application to e.g. test calls to your remote services via HTTP fast and easy. For application servers you need to bundle and deploy your app what takes more time and limits you in various ways. We are aware that this has improved in the past but also spring continuously improves and is always way ahead in this area. Further, with spring you have your configurations bundled together with the code in version control (still with ability to handle different environments) while with application servers these are configured externally and can not be easily tested during development.\nDocumentation\nSpring has an extremely open and active community. There is documentation for everything available for free on the web. You will find solutions to almost any problem on platforms like stackoverflow. If you have a problem you are only a google search away from your solution. This is very much different for proprietary application server products.\nHelpful Exception Messages\nSpring is really great for developers on exception messages. If you do something wrong you get detailed and helpful messages that guide you to the problem or even the solution. This is not as great in application servers.\nFuture-proof\nSpring has evolved really awesome over time. Since its 1.0 release in 2004 spring has continuously been improved and always caught up with important trends and innovations. Even in critical situations, when the company behind it (interface21) was sold, spring went on perfectly.\nJEE went through a lot of trouble and crisis. Just look at the EJB pain stories. This happened often in the past and also recent. See JEE 8 in crisis.\nFree\nSpring and its ecosystem is free and open-source. It still perfectly integrates with commercial solutions for specific needs. Most application servers are commercial and cost a lot of money. As of today the ROI for this is of question.\nFun\nIf you go to conferences or ask developers you will see that spring is popular and fun. If new developers are forced to use an old application server product they will be less motivated or even get frustrated. Especially in today&#x2019;s agile projects this is a very important aspect. In the end you will get into trouble with maintenance on the long run if you rely on a proprietary application server.\nOf course the vendors of application servers will tell you a different story. This is simply because they still make a lot of money from their products. We do not get paid from application servers nor from spring. We are just developers who love to build great systems. A good reason for application servers is that they combine a set of solutions to particular aspects to one product that helps to standardize your IT. However, devonfw fills exactly this gap for the spring ecosystem in a very open and flexible way. However, there is one important aspect that you need to understand and be aware of:\nSome big companies decided for a specific application server as their IT strategy. They may have hundreds of apps running with this application server. All their operators and developers have learned a lot of specific skills for this product and are familiar with it. If you are implementing yet another (small) app in this context it can make sense to stick with this application server. However, also they have to be aware that with every additional app they increase their technical debt.\n"},{"id":209,"path":"../..\\..\\..\\..\\..\\xampp\\htdocs\\devonfw.github.io\\website\\pages\\docs/devon4j.asciidoc_guides.html#guide-kafka.asciidoc","type":"docs","title":"Messaging Services","body":"12.36.

Retry\nThe retry pattern in devon4j-kafka is invoked when a particular exception(described by user in application.properties file) is thrown while processing the consumed message and it is configured in application.properties file. Then general idea is to separate messages which could not be processed into dedicated retry-topics to allow fine control on how processing of the messages is retried and to not block newly arriving messages.\nLet us see more about handling retry in the below topics.\nHandling retry in devon4j-kafka\nThe retry pattern is included in the starter dependency of &quot;starter-kafka-receiver&quot;.\nThe retryPattern method is used by calling the method processMessageWithRetry(ConsumerRecord&lt;K, V&gt; consumerRecord,MessageProcessor&lt;K, V&gt; processor). Please find the below Example:\n@Inject\nprivate MessageRetryOperations&lt;K, V&gt; messageRetryOperations;\n@Inject\nprivate DeleteEmployeeMessageProcessor&lt;K, V&gt; deleteEmployeeMessageProcessor;\n@KafkaListener(topics = &quot;employeeapp-employee-v1-delete&quot;, groupId = &quot;${messaging.kafka.consumer.groupId}&quot;,containerFactory = &quot;kafkaListenerContainerFactory&quot;)\npublic void consumer(ConsumerRecord&lt;K, V&gt; consumerRecord, Acknowledgment acknowledgment) {\nthis.messageRetryOperations.processMessageWithRetry(consumerRecord, this.deleteEmployeeMessageProcessor);\n// Acknowledge the listener.\nacknowledgment.acknowledge();\n}\nThe implementation for MessageProcessor from devon4j-kafka is required to provide the implementation to process the ConsumedRecord from kafka broker. The implementation for MessageProcessor interface can look as below example:\nimport com.devonfw.module.kafka.common.messaging.retry.api.client.MessageProcessor;\n@Named\npublic class DeleteEmployeeMessageProcessor&lt;K, V&gt; implements MessageProcessor&lt;K, V&gt; {\n@Override\npublic void processMessage(ConsumerRecord&lt;K, V&gt; message) {\n//process message\n}\n}\nIt works as follows:\n* The application gets a message from the topic.\n* During processing of the message an error occurs, the message will be written to the redelivery topic.\n* The message is acknowledged in the topic.\n* The message will be processed from the re-delivery topic after a delay.\n* Processing of the message fails again. It retires until the retry count gets over.\n* When the retry fails in all the retry then the message is logged and payload in the ProducerRecord is deleted for log\ncompaction which is explained below.\nRetry configuration and naming convention of redelivery topics.\nThe following properties should be added in the application.properties or application.yml file.\nThe retry pattern in devon4j-kafka will perform for specific topic of a message. So its mandatory to specify the properties for each topic. Below properties are example,\n# Back off policy properties for employeeapp-employee-v1-delete\nmessaging.retry.back-off-policy.retryReEnqueueDelay.employeeapp-employee-v1-delete=1000\nmessaging.retry.back-off-policy.retryDelay.employeeapp-employee-v1-delete=600000\nmessaging.retry.back-off-policy.retryDelayMultiplier.employeeapp-employee-v1-delete=1.0\nmessaging.retry.back-off-policy.retryMaxDelay.employeeapp-employee-v1-delete=600000\nmessaging.retry.back-off-policy.retryCount.employeeapp-employee-v1-delete=2\n# Retry policy properties for employeeapp-employee-v1-delete\nmessaging.retry.retry-policy.retryPeriod.employeeapp-employee-v1-delete=1800\nmessaging.retry.retry-policy.retryableExceptions.employeeapp-employee-v1-delete=&lt;Class names of exceptions for which a retry should be performed&gt;\nmessaging.retry.retry-policy.retryableExceptionsTraverseCauses.employeeapp-employee-v1-delete=true\n# Back off policy properties for employeeapp-employee-v1-add\nmessaging.retry.back-off-policy.retryReEnqueueDelay.employeeapp-employee-v1-add=1000\nmessaging.retry.back-off-policy.retryDelay.employeeapp-employee-v1-add=600000\nmessaging.retry.back-off-policy.retryDelayMultiplier.employeeapp-employee-v1-add=2.0\nmessaging.retry.back-off-policy.retryMaxDelay.employeeapp-employee-v1-add=600000\nmessaging.retry.back-off-policy.retryCount.employeeapp-employee-v1-add=4\n# Retry policy properties for employeeapp-employee-v1-add\nmessaging.retry.retry-policy.retryPeriod.employeeapp-employee-v1-add=3000\nmessaging.retry.retry-policy.retryableExceptions.employeeapp-employee-v1-add=&lt;Class names of exceptions for which a retry should be performed&gt;\nmessaging.retry.retry-policy.retryableExceptionsTraverseCauses.employeeapp-employee-v1-add=true\nIf you notice the above properties, the retry-policy and back-off policy properties are repeated twice as i have 2 topics for the retry to be performed with different level of values. The topic name should be added at the last of attribute.\nSo, the retry will be performed for each topic according to their configuration values.\nIf you want to provide same/default values for all the topics, then its required to add default in the place of topic on the above properties example.\nFor example,\n# Default back off policy properties\nmessaging.retry.back-off-policy.retryReEnqueueDelay.default=1000\nmessaging.retry.back-off-policy.retryDelay.default=600000\nmessaging.retry.back-off-policy.retryDelayMultiplier.default=1.0\nmessaging.retry.back-off-policy.retryMaxDelay.default=600000\nmessaging.retry.back-off-policy.retryCount.default=2\n# Default retry policy properties\nmessaging.retry.retry-policy.retryPeriod.default=1800\nmessaging.retry.retry-policy.retryableExceptions.default=&lt;Class names of exceptions for which a retry should be performed&gt;\nmessaging.retry.retry-policy.retryableExceptionsTraverseCauses.default=true\nBy giving properties like above , the same values will be passed for all the topics and the way of processing retry for all the topics are same.\nAll these above property values are mapped to the classes DefaultBackOffPolicyProperties.java and DefaultRetryPolicyProperties.java and configured by the class MessageDefaultRetryConfig.java.\nThe MessageRetryContext in devon kafka is used to perform the retry pattern with the properties from DefaultBackOffPolicyProperties and DefaultRetryPolicyProperties.\nThe 2 main properties of MessageRetryContext is nextRetry and retryUntil which is a Instant date format and it is calculated internally using the properties given in DefaultBackOffPolicyProperties and DefaultRetryPolicyProperties.\nYou may change the behavior of this date calculation by providing your own implementation classes for MessageBackOffPolicy.java and MessageRetryPolicy.java.\nThe naming convention for retry topic is the same topic name which you have given to publish the message and we add suffix -retry to it once it is consumed and given to process with retry.\nIf there is no topic found in the consumed record the default retry topic will be added which is default-message-retry.\nRetry topics\nDevon4j-kafka uses a separate retry topic for each topic where retries occur. By default this topic is named &lt;topic name&gt;-retry. You may change this behavior by providing your own implementation for DefaultKafkaRecordSupport which is an default implementation from devon4j-kafka for KafkaRecordSupport.\nDevon4-kafka enqueues a new message for each retry attempt. It is very important to configure your retry tropics with log compaction enabled. More or less simplified, if log compaction is enabled Kafka keeps only one message per message key. Since each retry message has the same key, in fact only one message per retry attempt is stored. After the last retry attempt the message payload is removed from the message so, you do not keep unnecessary data in your topics.\nHandling retry finally failed\nPer default when the retry fails with final attempt we just log the message and delete the payload of ProducerRecord which comes to proceed the retry pattern.\nYou can change this behavior by providing the implementation class for the interface MessageRetryHandler.java\nwhich has two method retryTimeout and retryFailedFinal.\n"},{"id":216,"path":"../..\\..\\..\\..\\..\\xampp\\htdocs\\devonfw.github.io\\website\\pages\\docs/devon4j.asciidoc_guides.html#guide-kafka.asciidoc_tracer","type":"docs","title":"Tracer","body":"12.36.7.

The timeout for\nthe check (default 60s) maybe changed via the property messaging.kafka.health.timeout.\nIf an application uses multiple broker(-clusters) for each broker(-cluster) a dedicated health indicator bean has to be\nconfigured in the spring config.\nThe properties for the devon kafka health check should be given like below example:\nmanagement.endpoint.health.enabled=&lt;true or false&gt;\nmessaging.kafka.health.timeout=&lt;the health check timeout seconds&gt;\nmessaging.kafka.health.topicsToCheck=employeeapp-employee-v1-delete,employeeapp-employee-v1-add\nThese properties are provided with default values except the topicsToCheck and health check will do happen only when the property is management.endpoint.health.enabled=true.\n"},{"id":219,"path":"../..\\..\\..\\..\\..\\xampp\\htdocs\\devonfw.github.io\\website\\pages\\docs/devon4j.asciidoc_guides.html#guide-kafka.asciidoc_authentication","type":"docs","title":"Authentication","body":"12.36.10.

How to provide monitoring information\nJava Management Extensions (JMX)\nJMX is the official java monitoring solution. It is part of the JDK. Your application may provide monitoring information or receive monitoring related commands via MBeans. There is a huge amount of information about JMX available. A good starting point might be JMX on wikipedia.\nTraditionally JMX uses RMI for communication. In many environments HTTP(S) is preferred, so be careful on deciding if JMX is the right solution.\nAlternativly your application could provide a monitoring API via REST.\nREST APIs\nSince REST APIs are very popular it is quite natural to provide monitoring information via REST. If your application already uses REST and there is no JMX/RMI based monitoring solution in place, it is often a better approach to provide monitoring APIs via REST than introducing a new protocol with JMX.\nLogging\nSome aspects of monitoring are covered by &quot;logging&quot;. A typical case might be the requirement to &quot;monitor&quot; the application REST APIs. For that it is perfectly fine to log the perfomance of all (or some) request and ship this information to a logging system like Graylog. So please carefully read the logging guide.

Which monitoring informaton to provide?\nIt is not possible to provide a final list of which monitoring information is exactly required for your application. But we give you a general advice what type of information your application should provide at a minimum.\nGeneral information\nIt is often useful if your application provides basic information about itself. This should cover\nThe name of the application\nThe version (or buildno., or commit-id, &#x2026;&#x200B;) of the application\nThis is espicially useful in complex environments, e.g. to very that deployments went correctly.\nMetrics\nMetric means providing key figures about your applications like\nperformance key figures\nrequest duration\nqueue lengths\nduration of database queries\n..\nbusiness related information\nnumber of successful / unsuccesful requests\nsize of result sets\nworth of shopping baskets\n..\nTechnical key figures\nJVM heap usage\ncache sizes\n(database) pool usage\n&#x2026;&#x200B;\n&#x2026;&#x200B;\nRemember that processing of this data should be done mainly in the monitoring system. You might have noticed that there are different types of metrics: those that represent current values (like JVM heap usage, queue length, &#x2026;&#x200B;), others base on (timed) events like (duration of requests). Handling of different types of metrics might be different.\nFor handling events you may:\nWrite log statements for each (or a sample of) event. These logs must then be shipped to your monitoring systems.\nSend data for the event via an API of your monitoring system\nProvide a REST API (or JMX MBeans) with pre-aggregated key figures, which is periodically polled by your monitoring system. This solution is a bit inferior since the aggregation is part of your application and might not fit to the desired visualization in your monitoring systems.\nFor actual values you may:\nWrite them perodically to your log. These logs must then be shipped to your monitoring systems.\nSend them peridocally via an API of your monitoring systems\nProvide a REST API (or JMX MBeans) which is periodically polled by your monitoring system.\nHealth (Watchdog)\nFor monitoring a complex application landscape it is crucial to have an exact overview if all applications are up and running. So your application should offer an API for the monitoring system which allows to easily check if the application is alive. Often this alive information is polled by the monitoring system with a kind of watchdog.\nThe health check should include checks if the application is working &quot;correctly&quot;. For that we suggest to check if all required neighbour systems and infrastructure components are usable:\nCheck if your database can be queried (with a dummy query)\nCheck if you can reach your messaging system\nCheck if you can reach all your neighbour system, e.g. by querying their info-endpoint\nYou should be very careful to not cascade those requests, e.g. your system should only test their direct neighbours. This test should not lead to additional tests in these systems.\nThe healthcheck should return a simple OK/NOK result for use in dashboards, but addtionally include detailed results for each check.\n"},{"id":228,"path":"../..\\..\\..\\..\\..\\xampp\\htdocs\\devonfw.github.io\\website\\pages\\docs/devon4j.asciidoc_guides.html#guide-monitoring.asciidoc_implementation-with-spring-boot-actuator","type":"docs","title":"Implementation with Spring Boot Actuator","body":"12.38.3.

Actuator offers APIs which provide monitoring information including metrics via HTTP and JMX.

Be careful not to expose any security related information via this mechanismen (e.g. by exposing those endpoints externally).\nTo make the info-endpoint useful you need to provide information to actuactor. A good way to achive this is by using the provided maven module.\nFor first steps it might be useful to deactive security for the actuator endpoints (this is just for testing, never release it!). This can be accomblished by implementing the following class:\n@Configuration\n@EnableWebSecurity\n@Profile(SpringProfileConstants.NOT_JUNIT)\npublic class WebSecurityConfig extends BaseWebSecurityConfig {\n@Override\npublic void configure(WebSecurity web) throws Exception {\nsuper.configure(web);\nweb.ignoring().requestMatchers(EndpointRequest.toAnyEndpoint());\n}\n}\nDevonfw additions\nDevonfw includes the following additions for Spring boot actuator:\nKafka Health Check in devon4j-kafka (WIP)\n"},{"id":229,"path":"../..\\..\\..\\..\\..\\xampp\\htdocs\\devonfw.github.io\\website\\pages\\docs/devon4j.asciidoc_guides.html#guide-monitoring.asciidoc_integration-of-monitoring-information","type":"docs","title":"Integration of monitoring information","body":"12.38.4.

The loadbalancer will periodically poll the service to find out if is available or not.\nTo configure this you may use the healthcheck of the service to find out if the instance is functioning correctly or not.\nDocker\nDocker supports a healtcheck. You may use a simple local curl to your application here to find out if the service is healthy or not. But be careful often unhealthy containers are automatically restarted. If you use the health information of your application this may lead to undesired effects. Since the health checks relies on querying all neighbour systems and infrastucure components, applications often become unhealthy because a 3rd system has problems. Restarting the application itself will not heal the problem and be inexpedient.

Motivation\nWhy versioning of services? First of all, you should only care about this topic if you really have to. Service versioning is complex and requires effort (time and budget). The best way to avoid this is to be smart in the first place when designing the service API.\nFurther, if you are creating services where the only consumer is e.g. the web-client that you deploy together with the consumed services then you can change your service without the overhead to create new service versions and keeping old service versions for compatibility.\nHowever, if the following indicators are given you typically need to do service versioning:\nYour service is part of a complex and distributed IT landscape\nYour service requires incompatible changes\nThere are many consumers or there is at least one (relevant) consumer that can not be updated at the same time or is entirely out of control (unknown or totally different party/company)\nWhat are incompatible changes?\nAlmost any change when SOAP is used (as it changes the WSDL and breaks the contract). Therefore, we recommend to use REST instead. Then, only the following changes are critical.\nA change where existing properties (attributes) have to change their name\nA change where existing features (properties, operations, etc.) have to change their semantics (meaning)\nWhat changes do not cause incompatibilities?\nAdding new service operations is entirely uncritical with REST.\nAdding new properties is only a problem in the following cases:\nAdding new mandatory properties to the input of a service is causing incompatibilities. This problem can be avoided by contract-design.\nIf a consumer is using a service to read data, modify it and then save it back via a service and a property is added to the data, then this property might be lost. This is not a problem with dynamic languages such as JavaScript/TypeScript but with strictly typed languages such as Java. In Java you will typically use structured typed transfer-objects (and not Map&lt;String, Object&gt;) so new properties that have been added but are not known to the consumer can not be mapped to the transfer-object and will be lost. When saving that transfer-object later the property will be gone. It might be impossible to determine the difference between a lost property and a property that was removed on purpose. This is a general problem that you need to be aware of and that you have to consider by your design in such situations.\nEven if you hit an indicator for incompatible changes you can still think about adding a new service operation instead of changing an existing one (and deprecating the old one). Be creative to simplify and avoid extra effort.\n"},{"id":244,"path":"../..\\..\\..\\..\\..\\xampp\\htdocs\\devonfw.github.io\\website\\pages\\docs/devon4j.asciidoc_layers.html#guide-service-versioning.asciidoc_procedure","type":"docs","title":"Procedure","body":"11.3.2.

Versioning Schema\nIn general anything can be used to differentiate versions of a service. Possibilities are:\nCode names (e.g. Strawberry, Blueberry, Grapefruit)\nTimestamps (YYYYMMDD-HHmmSS)\nSequential version numbers (e.g. v1, v2, v3)\nComposed version numbers (e.g. 1.0.48-pre-alpha-3-20171231-235959-Strawberry)\nAs we are following the KISS principle (see key principles) we propose to use sequential version numbers. These are short, clear, and easy while still allowing to see what version is after another one. Especially composed version numbers (even 1.1 vs. 2.0) lead to decisions and discussions that easily waste more time than adding value. It is still very easy to maintain an Excel sheet or release-notes document that is explaining the changes for each version (v1, v2, v3) of a particular service.\nWe suggest to always add the version schema to the service URL to be prepared for service versioning even if service versioning is not (yet) actively used. For simplicity it is explicitly stated that you may even do incompatible changes to the current version (typically v1) of your service if you can update the according consumers within the same deployment.\n"},{"id":246,"path":"../..\\..\\..\\..\\..\\xampp\\htdocs\\devonfw.github.io\\website\\pages\\docs/devon4j.asciidoc_layers.html#guide-service-versioning.asciidoc_practice","type":"docs","title":"Practice","body":"11.3.4. Practice\nSo assuming you know that you have to do service versioning, the question is how to do it practically in the code.\nThe approach for your devon4j project in case of code-first should be as described below:\nDetermine which types in the code need to be changed. It is likely to be the API and implementation of the according service but it may also impact transfer objects and potentially even datatypes.\nCreate new packages for all these concerned types containing the current version number (e.g. v1).\nCopy all these types to that new packages.\nRename these copies so they carry the version number as suffix (e.g. V1).\nIncrease the version of the service in the unversioned package (e.g. from v1 to v2).\nNow you have two versions of the same service (e.g. v1 and v2) but so far they behave exactly the same.\nYou start with your actual changes and modify the original files that have been copied before.\nYou will also ensure the links (import statements) of the copied types point to the copies with the version number\nThis will cause incompatibilities (and compile errors) in the copied service. Therefore, you need to fix that service implementation to map from the old API to the new API and behavior. In some cases, this may be easy (e.g. mapping x.y.z.v1.FooTo to x.y.z.FooTo using bean-mapping with some custom mapping for the incompatible changes), in other cases this can get very complex. Be aware of this complexity from the start before you make your decision about service versioning.\nAs far as possible this mapping should be done in the service-layer, not to pollute your business code in the core-layer with versioning-aspects. If there is no way to handle it in the service layer, e.g. you need some data from the persistence-layer, implement the &quot;mapping&quot; in the core-layer then, but don&#x2019;t forget to remove this code, when removing the old service version.\nFinally, ensure that both the old service behaves as before as well as the new service works as planned.\nModularization\nFor modularization, we also follow the KISS principle (see key principles):\nwe suggest to have one api module per application that will contain the most recent version of your service and get released with every release-version of the application. The compatibility code with the versioned packages will be added to the core module and therefore is not exposed via the api module (because it has already been exposed in the previous release of the app). This way, you can always determine for sure which version of a service is used by another application just by its maven dependencies.\nThe KISS approach with only a single module that may contain multiple services (e.g. one for each business component) will cause problems when you want to have mixed usages of service versions: You can not use an old version of one service and a new version of another service from the same APP as then you would need to have its API module twice as a dependency on different versions, which is not possible. However, to avoid complicated overhead we always suggest to follow this easy approach. Only if you come to the point that you really need this complexity you can still solve it (even afterwards by publishing another maven artefact). As we are all on our way to build more but smaller applications (SOA, microservices, etc.) we should always start simple and only add complexity when really needed.\nThe following example gives an idea of the structure:\n/&#xAB;my-app&#xBB;\n&#x251C;&#x2500;&#x2500;/api\n| &#x2514;&#x2500;&#x2500;/src/main/java/\n| &#x2514;&#x2500;&#x2500;/&#xAB;rootpackage&#xBB;/&#xAB;application&#xBB;/&#xAB;component&#xBB;\n| &#x251C;&#x2500;&#x2500;/common/api/to\n| | &#x2514;&#x2500;&#x2500;FooTo\n| &#x2514;&#x2500;&#x2500;/service/api/rest\n| &#x2514;&#x2500;&#x2500;FooRestService\n&#x2514;&#x2500;&#x2500;/core\n&#x2514;&#x2500;&#x2500;/src/main/java/\n&#x2514;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#xAB;rootpackage&#xBB;/&#xAB;application&#xBB;/&#xAB;component&#xBB;\n&#x251C;&#x2500;&#x2500;/common/api/to/v1\n| &#x2514;&#x2500;&#x2500;FooToV1\n&#x2514;&#x2500;&#x2500;/service\n&#x251C;&#x2500;&#x2500;/api/rest/v1\n| &#x2514;&#x2500;&#x2500;FooRestServiceV1\n&#x2514;&#x2500;&#x2500;impl/rest\n&#x251C;&#x2500;&#x2500;/v1\n| &#x2514;&#x2500;&#x2500; FooRestServiceImplV1\n&#x2514;&#x2500;&#x2500;FooRestServiceImpl\n"},{"id":247,"path":"../..\\..\\..\\..\\..\\xampp\\htdocs\\devonfw.github.io\\website\\pages\\docs/devon4j.asciidoc_layers.html#guide-logic-layer.asciidoc","type":"docs","title":"Logic Layer","body":"11.4.

This implies that you have a proper authorization in place. This is especially tricky when your authorization does not only rely on the type of the data and according to static permissions but also on the data itself. Vulnerabilities for this threat can easily happen by design flaws and inadvertence. Here is an example from our sample application:\nWe have a generic use-case to manage BLOBs. In the first place, it makes sense to write a generic REST service to load and save these BLOBs. However, the permission to read or even update such BLOB depends on the business object hosting the BLOB. Therefore, such a generic REST service would open the door for this OWASP A4 vulnerability. To solve this in a secure way, you need individual services for each hosting business object to manage the linked BLOB and have to check permissions based on the parent business object. In this example the ID of the BLOB would be the direct object reference and the ID of the business object (and a BLOB property indicator) would be the indirect object reference.\n"},{"id":250,"path":"../..\\..\\..\\..\\..\\xampp\\htdocs\\devonfw.github.io\\website\\pages\\docs/devon4j.asciidoc_layers.html#guide-component-facade.asciidoc","type":"docs","title":"Component Facade","body":"11.4.3.

UseCase\nA use-case is a small unit of the logic layer responsible for an operation on a particular entity (business object).\nIt is defined by an interface (API) with its according implementation.\nFollowing our architecture-mapping, use-cases are named Uc&#xAB;Operation&#xBB;&#xAB;BusinessObject&#xBB;[Impl]. The prefix Uc stands for use-case and allows to easily find and identify them in your IDE. The &#xAB;Operation&#xBB; stands for a verb that is operated on the entity identified by &#xAB;BusinessObject&#xBB;.\nFor CRUD we use the standard operations Find and Manage that can be generated by CobiGen. This also separates read and write operations (e.g. if you want to do CQSR, or to configure read-only transactions for read operations).\nFind\nThe UcFind&#xAB;BusinessObject&#xBB; defines all read operations to retrieve and search the &#xAB;BusinessObject&#xBB;.\nHere is an example:\npublic interface UcFindBooking {\nBookingEto findBooking(Long id);\nBookingCto findBookingCto(Long id);\nPage&lt;BookingEto&gt; findBookingEtos(BookingSearchCriteriaTo criteria);\nPage&lt;BookingCto&gt; findBookingCtos(BookingSearchCriteriaTo criteria);\n}\nManage\nThe UcManage&#xAB;BusinessObject&#xBB; defines all CRUD write operations (create, update and delete) for the &#xAB;BusinessObject&#xBB;.\nHere is an example:\npublic interface UcManageBooking {\nBookingEto saveBooking(BookingEto booking);\nboolean deleteBooking(Long id);\n}\nCustom\nAny other non CRUD operation Uc&#xAB;Operation&#xBB;&#xAB;BusinessObject&#xBB; uses any other custom verb for &#xAB;Operation&#xBB;.\nTypically, such custom use-cases only define a single method.\nHere is an example:\npublic interface UcApproveBooking {\nvoid approveBooking(BookingEto booking);\n}\nImplementation\nFor the implementation of a use-cas, the same rules that are described for the component-facade implementation.\n.\nHowever, when following the use-case approach, your component facade simply changes to:\npublic interface Bookingmanagement extends UcFindBooking, UcManageBooking, UcApproveBooking {\n}\nWhere the implementation only delegates to the use-cases and gets entirely generated by CobiGen:\npublic class BookingmanagementImpl implements {\n@Inject\nprivate UcFindBooking ucFindBooking;\n@Inject\nprivate UcManageBooking ucManageBooking;\n@Inject\nprivate UcApproveBooking ucApproveBooking;\n@Override\npublic BookingEto findBooking(Long id) {\nreturn this.ucFindBooking.findBooking(id);\n}\n@Override\npublic Page&lt;BookingEto&gt; findBookingEtos(BookingSearchCriteriaTo criteria) {\nreturn this.ucFindBooking.findBookingEtos(criteria);\n}\n@Override\npublic BookingEto saveBooking(BookingEto booking) {\nreturn this.ucManageBooking.saveBooking(booking);\n}\n@Override\npublic boolean deleteBooking(Long id) {\nreturn this.ucManageBooking.deleteBooking(booking);\n}\n@Override\npublic void approveBooking(BookingEto booking) {\nthis.ucApproveBooking.approveBooking(booking);\n}\n...\n}\nThis approach is also illustrated by the following UML diagram:\nInternal use case\nSometimes, a component with multiple related entities and many use-cases needs to reuse business logic internally.\nOf course, this can be exposed as an official use-case API but this will imply using transfer-objects (ETOs) instead of entities. In some cases, this is undesired e.g. for better performance to prevent unnecessary mapping of entire collections of entities.\nIn the first place, you should try to use abstract base implementations providing reusable methods the actual use-case implementations can inherit from.\nIf your business logic is even more complex and you have multiple aspects of business logic to share and reuse but also run into multi-inheritance issues, you may also just create use-cases that have their interface located in the impl scope package right next to the implementation (or you may just skip the interface). In such a case, you may define methods that directly take or return entity objects.\nTo avoid confusion with regular use-cases, we recommend to add the Internal suffix to the type name leading to Uc&#xAB;Operation&#xBB;&#xAB;BusinessObject&#xBB;Internal[Impl].\nInjection issues\nTechnically, now you have two implementations of your use-case:\nthe direct implementation of the use-case (Uc*Impl)\nthe component facade implementation (&#xAB;Component&#xBB;Impl)\nWhen injecting a use-case interface this could cause ambiguities.\nThis is addressed as following:\nIn the component facade implementation (&#xAB;Component&#xBB;Impl) spring is smart enough to resolve the ambiguity as it assumes that a spring bean never wants to inject itself (it can already be an access via this).\nTherefore, only the proper use-case implementation remains as a candidate and injection works as expected.\nIn all other places, simply always inject the component facade interface instead of the use-case.\nIn case you might have the lucky occasion to hit this nice exception:\norg.springframework.beans.factory.BeanCurrentlyInCreationException: Error creating bean with name &apos;uc...Impl&apos;: Bean with name &apos;uc...Impl&apos; has been injected into other beans [...Impl] in its raw version as part of a circular reference, but has eventually been wrapped. This means that said other beans do not use the final version of the bean. This is often the result of over-eager type matching - consider using &apos;getBeanNamesOfType&apos; with the &apos;allowEagerInit&apos; flag turned off, for example.\nTo get rid of such an error you need to annotate your according implementation also with @Lazy in addition to @Named.\n"},{"id":252,"path":"../..\\..\\..\\..\\..\\xampp\\htdocs\\devonfw.github.io\\website\\pages\\docs/devon4j.asciidoc_layers.html#guide-dataaccess-layer.asciidoc","type":"docs","title":"Data-Access Layer","body":"11.5.

Layering\nBatches are implemented in the batch layer. The batch layer is responsible for batch processes, whereas the business logic is implemented in the logic layer. Compared to the service layer, you may understand the batch layer just as a different way of accessing the business logic.\nFrom a component point of view, each batch is implemented as a subcomponent in the corresponding business component.\nThe business component is defined by the business architecture.\nLet&#x2019;s make an example for that. The sample application implements a batch for exporting ingredients. This ingredientExportJob belongs to the dishmanagement business component.\nSo the ingredientExportJob is implemented in the following package:\n&lt;basepackage&gt;.dishmanagement.batch.impl.*\nBatches should invoke use cases in the logic layer for doing their work.\nOnly &quot;batch specific&quot; technical aspects should be implemented in the batch layer.\nExample:\nFor a batch, which imports product data from a CSV file, this means that all code for actually reading and parsing the CSV input file is implemented in the batch layer.\nThe batch calls the use case &quot;create product&quot; in the logic layer for actually creating the products for each line read from the CSV input file.\nDirectly accessing data access layer\nIn practice, it is not always appropriate to create use cases for every bit of work a batch should do. Instead, the data access layer can be used directly.\nAn example for that is a typical batch for data retention which deletes out-of-time data.\nOften deleting, out-dated data is done by invoking a single SQL statement. It is appropriate to implement that SQL in a Repository or DAO method and call this method directly from the batch.\nBut be careful: this pattern is a simplification which could lead to business logic cluttered in different layers, which reduces the maintainability of your application.\nIt is a typical design decision you have to make when designing your specific batches.\n"},{"id":256,"path":"../..\\..\\..\\..\\..\\xampp\\htdocs\\devonfw.github.io\\website\\pages\\docs/devon4j.asciidoc_layers.html#guide-batch-layer.asciidoc_project-structure-and-packaging","type":"docs","title":"Project structure and packaging","body":"11.6.2.

Authentication\nMost business application incorporate authentication and authorization.\nYour spring boot application will implement some kind of security, e.g. integrated login with username+password or in many cases authentication via an existing IAM.\nFor security reasons your batch should also implement an authentication mechanism and obey the authorization implemented in your application (e.g. via @RolesAllowed).\nSince there are many different authentication mechanism we cannot provide an out-of-the-box solution in devonfw, but we describe a pattern how this can be implemented in devonfw batches.\nWe suggest to implement the authentication in a Spring Batch tasklet, which runs as the first step in your batch. This tasklet will do all of the work which is required to authenticate the batch. A simple example which authenticates the batch &quot;locally&quot; via username and password could be implemented like this:\n@Named\npublic class SimpleAuthenticationTasklet implements Tasklet {\n@Override\npublic RepeatStatus execute(StepContribution contribution, ChunkContext chunkContext) throws Exception {\nString username = chunkContext.getStepContext().getStepExecution().getJobParameters().getString(&quot;username&quot;);\nString password = chunkContext.getStepContext().getStepExecution().getJobParameters().getString(&quot;password&quot;);\nAuthentication authentication = new UsernamePasswordAuthenticationToken(username, password);\nSecurityContextHolder.getContext().setAuthentication(authentication);\nreturn RepeatStatus.FINISHED;\n}\n}\nThe username and password have to be supplied via two cli parameters -username and -password. This implementation creates an &quot;authenticated&quot; Authentication and sets in the Spring Security context. This is just for demonstration normally you should not provide passwords via command line. The actual authentication will be done automatically via Spring Security as in your &quot;normal&quot; application.\nIf you have a more complex authentication mechanism in your application e.g. via OpenID connect just call this in the tasklet. Naturally you may read authentication parameters (e.g. secrets) from the command line or more securely from a configuration file.\nIn your Job Configuration set this tasklet as the first step:\n@Configuration\n@EnableBatchProcessing\npublic class BookingsExportBatchConfig {\n@Inject\nprivate JobBuilderFactory jobBuilderFactory;\n@Inject\nprivate StepBuilderFactory stepBuilderFactory;\n@Bean\npublic Job myBatchJob() {\nreturn this.jobBuilderFactory.get(&quot;myJob&quot;).start(myAuthenticationStep()).next(...).build();\n}\n@Bean\npublic Step myAuthenticationStep() {\nreturn this.stepBuilderFactory.get(&quot;myAuthenticationStep&quot;).tasklet(myAuthenticatonTasklet()).build();\n}\n@Bean\npublic Tasklet myAuthenticatonTasklet() {\nreturn new SimpleAuthenticationTasklet();\n}\n...\n"},{"id":264,"path":"../..\\..\\..\\..\\..\\xampp\\htdocs\\devonfw.github.io\\website\\pages\\docs/devon4j.asciidoc_layers.html#guide-batch-layer.asciidoc_tipps--tricks","type":"docs","title":"Tipps &amp; tricks","body":"11.6.9.

HTTP layer\nBy using NestJS, devon4node is a platform-agnostic framework. NestJS focuses only on the logical layer, and delegates the transport layer to another framework, such as ExpressJS. You can see it in the following diagram:\nAs you can see, NestJS do not listen directly for incoming request. It has an adapter to communicate with ExpressJS and ExpressJS is the responsible for that. ExpressJS is only one of the frameworks that NestJS can work with. We have also another adapter available out-of-the-box: the Fastify adapter. With that, you can replace ExpressJS for Fastify But you can still use all your NestJS components. You can also create your own adapter to make NestJS work with other HTTP framework.\nAt this point, you may think: why is NestJS (and devon4node) using ExpressJS by default instead of Fastify? Because, as you can see in the previous diagram, there is a component that is dependent on the HTTP framework: the middleware. As ExpressJS is the most widely used framework, there exists a lot of middleware for it, so, in order to reuse them in our NestJS applications, NestJS use ExpressJS by default.

NestJS components\nNestJS provides several components that you can use in your application:\nControllers\nProviders\nMiddleware\nGuards\nInterceptors\nPipes\nException filters\nIn the NestJS documentation you can find all information about each component. But, something that is missing in the documentation is the execution order. Every component can be defined in different levels: globally, in the controller or in the handler. As middleware is part of the HTTP server we can define it in a different way: globally or in the module.\nIt is not necessary to have defined components in every level. For example, you can have defined a interceptor globally but you do not have any other in the controller or handler level. If nothing is defined in some level, the request will continue to the next component.\nAs you can see in the previous image, the first component which receive the request is the global defined middleware. Then, it send the request to the module middleware. Each of them can return a response to the client, without passing the request to the next level.\nThen, the request continue to the guards: first the global guard, next to controller guard and finally to the handler guard. At this point, we can throw an exception in all components and the exception filter will catch it and send a proper error message to the client. We do not paint the filters in the graphic in order to simplify it.\nAfter the guards, is time to interceptors: global interceptors, controller interceptors and handler interceptors. And last, before arrive to the handler inside the controller, the request pass through the pipes.\nWhen the handler has the response ready to send to the client, it does not go directly to the client. It come again to the interceptors, so we can also intercept the response. The order this time is the reverse: handler interceptors, controller interceptors and global interceptors. After that, we can finally send the response to the client.\nNow, with this in mind, you are able to create the components in a better way.\n&#x2191;&#xA0;Up:&#xA0;devon4node&#xA0;| &#x2302;&#xA0;Home:&#xA0;devonfw guide&#xA0;| Next:&#xA0;Layers&#xA0;&#x2192;\n"},{"id":277,"path":"../..\\..\\..\\..\\..\\xampp\\htdocs\\devonfw.github.io\\website\\pages\\docs/devonfw-ide-advanced.asciidoc.html#devonfw-ide-advanced.asciidoc","type":"docs","title":"Advanced Features","body":"6.

Keyboard\nKeyboard support is not an integration however, some users coming from other platforms may struggle with the way MacOS deals with (external non-apple) keyboards.\nSo to make it short: if you are happy with your keyboard and shortcuts, you can skip all the following. Otherwise, if you think that pressing keys like Home, End, etc. should just work as expected or pressing Alt Gr should allow you to type the special characters as printed on your German keyboard then here you will find a solution to your problems!\nTo get all automated you can just run the script system/mac/keyboard/install-mac-keyboard-support.sh (in ${DEVON_IDE_HOME}). If you would like to understand what is going on, you want to customize the keyboard settings to your needs, or you want a keyboard layout other than German ISO, please read on.\nKeyboard Layouts\nKeyboard layouts allow a find-grained mapping of each key on your keyboard to its resulting input character or behaviour. They are MacOS native features and do not need to have software running as a background service to make the keyboard mapping work (see Karabiner section below as an alternative).\nThey are provided as so called bundle (white lego brick icon). Like a MacOS app this is a folder containing a Contents folder with a specific sub-folder structure. In the Resources subfolder *.keylayout files are placed and define the exact mapping for the keyboard. As an example we provide a Keyboard Layouts folder containing a bundle for a German keyboard mapping.\nTo install keyboard layouts simply doubleclick the bundle or copy it to ~/Library/Keyboard Layouts. To actually use them go to System Preferences and select Keyboard. Then, select the tab Input Sources. With the + button you can add a keyboard layout for your daily usage with your mac. Please note that the keyboard layout shipped with devonfw-ide is called German-ISO and can be found in the Others section at the end of the list. It can be used as an example or template, if you want to create your own layout.\nWhen you have multiple mappings in place, on the top menu bar you will find a little icon next to the current time that allows you to switch between the keyboard layouts, which is very handy when you switch from your native MacBook keyboard to an external USB keyboard or vice versa.\nEven for a pure MacOS geek this can be helpful in case a friend coming from Windows/Linux is supposed to type something on the Mac in a pair-programming session.\nIn our German keyboard mapping example you can use the keys like Alt Gr, etc. to type special characters as you would expect and as printed on your keyboard. To make Pos1, End, etc. work properly accross all apps please read on to the next section(s).\nIn case you would like to create your own keyboard layout you can of course edit the *.keylayout files in a text editor. However, to make this much more comfortable, you can use the graphical editor tool Ukelele.\nBesides, the app itself, the Ukelele dmg file, also contains a Documentation and a Resources folder. The latter contains many keyboard layouts that you can use as a starting point.\nKey Bindings\nStill, various keyboard shortcuts might not work as expected for you. Therefore, we provide you with an advanced configuration in the folder system/mac/keyboard/KeyBindings that you can copy to your ~/Library folder:\ncd system/mac/keyboard/\ncp -r KeyBindings ~/Library\nTo make the changes work you need to log out and log in again or you can reboot. After that, your Home (Pos1) and End buttons should work as expected including with selection via Shift and/or Command. Also, you can use Command together with the left or right arrow key to move between words and combined it with Shift for selection. As an example, for further customization you can press Command + &lt; to type the unicode character &#xAB;.\nHowever, still some apps listen to keyboard events on a lower level and come with their own keyboard mappings. In these apps you might still experience unexpected behaviour. Solutions can be found in the following sub-sections.\nSwitch Control and Command\nIf you are used to windows or linux and get easily confused by the apple keyboard behaviour you might want to switch the Control and the Option key.\nOpen System Preferences and select Keyboard. Then, in the first tab, click on the button Modifier Keys&#x2026;&#x200B;. For every keyboard you can customize the behaviour of your modifier keys and therefore switch Control and Option as illustrated in the screenshot:\nProgrammers now should also disable that Control + Space is opening Spotlight Search as otherwise this shortcut can not be redifined in other apps like common IDEs.\nEclipse\nIn Eclipse, move and select by word as described above does not work. Even worse, the most important shortcut does not work: Control + Space for code completion (content assist). You can manually redefine the key bindings in Preferences under General &gt; Keys. However, with multiple IDE installations and workspaces this will quickly get tedious. Therefore, you can Export and Import specific Preferences such as Keys Preferences to/from a *.epf (Eclipse PreFerences) file.\nWe have done all this for you so you can just import the file located in system/mac/keyboard/Eclipse/eclipse-mac-keybindings.epf into your Eclipse. Happy coding.\nKarabiner\nIf you want more dynamics and do not worry about an app that has to run in the background to make your keyboard work as you like (no relevant performance overhead), you can try Karabiner Elements. This is a powerful tool to remap your keyboard shortcuts. In the UI you can only directly create and edit Simple Modifications that are too limited for most use-cases. However, using Complex Modifications you can do a lot of magic to customize the keyboard behaviour to your personal needs. A key with any combination of modifiers can be mapped to any key with arbitrary modifiers. This can also be bound to conditions based on the frontmost application or the keyboard model. These complex modifications are configured as *.json files. We have included a set with useful rules for external keyboards, programmer shortcuts, etc. If you have Karabiner installed, you only need to copy the contents of the karabiner folder located in this directory to your ~/.config folder:\ncd system/mac/keyboard/\ncp karabiner/assets/complex_modifications/*.json ~/.config/karabiner/assets/complex_modifications/\nNow, if you open the Complex Modifications in the Karabiner app, you can click on the + Add rule button and will see these mappings in the pop up. Select the rules you want to add (e.g. add all) and you are done. Unlike other solutions, you can quickly tweak your keyboard without the need to log out and restart apps, which gives faster trial and error turnarounds. Further, if you want to tweak your own configs, Karabiner comes with a secondary app called Karabiner-EventViewer that shows you the names of the keys, modifiers, and apps for the events you are triggering. This is very helpful to get the config right.\n"},{"id":289,"path":"../..\\..\\..\\..\\..\\xampp\\htdocs\\devonfw.github.io\\website\\pages\\docs/devonfw-ide-advanced.asciidoc.html#advanced-tooling-linux.asciidoc","type":"docs","title":"Linux Tooling","body":"6.4.

Features\nEvery developer needs great tools to work efficiently. Setting up these tools manually can be tedious and error-prone. Furthermore, some projects may require different versions and configurations of such tools. Especially configurations like code-formatters should be consistent within a project to avoid diff-wars.\nThe devonfw-ide will solve these issues. Here are the features you will find through devonfw-ide:\nEfficient\nSet up your IDE within minutes tailored for the requirements of your project.\nAutomated\nAutomate the setup and update, avoid manual steps and mistakes.\nSimple\nKISS (Keep It Small and Simple), no native installers that globally mess your OS or tool-integrations that break with every release. Instead, use templates and simple shell scripts.\nConfigurable\nYou can change the configuration depending on your needs. Furthermore, the settings contain configuration templates for the different tools (see configurator).\nMaintainable\nFor your project you should copy these settings to an own git repository that can be maintained and updated to manage the tool configurations during the project lifecycle. If you use github or gitlab every developer can easily suggest changes and improvements to these settings via pull/merge requests, which is easier to manage with big teams.\nCustomizable\nDo you need an additional tool you had never heard of before? Put it in the software folder of the structure. The devon CLI will then automatically add it to your PATH variable.\nFurther you can create your own commandlet for your additional tool. For closed-source tools you can create your own archive and distribute it to your team members as long as you care about the terms and licenses of these tools.\nMulti-platform\nIt works on all major platforms: Windows, Mac and Linux.\nMulti-tenancy\nYou can have several instances of the devonfw-ide &quot;installed&quot; on your machine for different projects with different tools, tool versions and configurations. You won&#x2019;t need to set up any physical installation nor changing your operating system. &quot;Installations&quot; of devonfw-ide do not interfere with each other nor with other installed software.\nMultiple Workspaces\nIt supports working with different workspaces on different branches. You can create and update new workspaces with a few clicks. You can see the workspace name in the title-bar of your IDE so you do not get confused and work on the right branch.\nFree\nThe devonfw-ide is free just like everything from devonfw.

A Contribution &apos;originates&apos; from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor&apos;s behalf. Contributions do not include additions to the Program which: (i) are separate modules of software distributed in conjunction with the Program under their own license agreement, and (ii) are not derivative works of the Program.\n&quot;Contributor&quot; means any person or entity that distributes the Program.\n&quot;Licensed Patents&quot; mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or when combined with the Program.\n&quot;Program&quot; means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this Agreement.\n&quot;Recipient&quot; means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement, including all Contributors.\n2. GRANT OF RIGHTS\na) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, and such derivative works, in source code and object code form.\nb) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code and object code form. This patent license shall apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is licensed hereunder.\nc) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent license is required to allow Recipient to distribute the Program, it is Recipient&apos;s responsibility to acquire that license before distributing the Program.\nd) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.\n3. REQUIREMENTS\nA Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under its own license agreement, provided that:\na) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and\nb) its license agreement:\ni) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties and conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose;\nii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;\niii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and\niv) states that source code for the Program is available from such Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used for software exchange.\nWhen the Program is made available in source code form:\na) it must be made available under this Agreement; and\nb) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program.\nContributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained within the Program.\nEach Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its Contribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution.\n4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION\nCommercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner which does not create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor (&quot;Commercial Contributor&quot;) hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every other Contributor (&quot;Indemnified Contributor&quot;) against any losses, damages and costs (collectively &quot;Losses&quot;) arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such claim at its own expense.\nFor example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor&apos;s responsibility alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the other Contributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay those damages.\n5. NO WARRANTY\nEXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement , including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.\n6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY\nEXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n7. GENERAL\nIf any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.\nIf Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or hardware) infringes such Recipient&apos;s patent(s), then such Recipient&apos;s rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.\nAll Recipient&apos;s rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient&apos;s rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable. However, Recipient&apos;s obligations under this Agreement and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and survive.\nEveryone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement, but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement from time to time. No one other than the Agreement Steward has the right to modify this Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation is the initial Agreement Steward. The Eclipse Foundation may assign the responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always be distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published, Contributor may elect to distribute the Program (including its Contributions) under the new version. Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved.\nThis Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and the intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No party to this Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement more than one year after the cause of action arose. Each party waives its rights to a jury trial in any resulting litigation.\n"},{"id":313,"path":"../..\\..\\..\\..\\..\\xampp\\htdocs\\devonfw.github.io\\website\\pages\\docs/devonfw-ide-support.asciidoc.html#license.asciidoc_eclipse-public-license---version-2.0","type":"docs","title":"Eclipse Public License - Version 2.0","body":"7.2.3.

This patent license shall apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is licensed hereunder.\nc) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent license is required to allow Recipient to Distribute the Program, it is Recipient&apos;s responsibility to acquire that license before distributing the Program.\nd) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.\ne) Notwithstanding the terms of any Secondary License, no Contributor makes additional grants to any Recipient (other than those set forth in this Agreement) as a result of such Recipient&apos;s receipt of the Program under the terms of a Secondary License (if permitted under the terms of Section 3).\n3. REQUIREMENTS\n3.1 If a Contributor Distributes the Program in any form, then:\na) the Program must also be made available as Source Code, in accordance with section 3.2, and the Contributor must accompany the Program with a statement that the Source Code for the Program is available under this Agreement, and informs Recipients how to obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used for software exchange; and\nb) the Contributor may Distribute the Program under a license different than this Agreement, provided that such license:\ni) effectively disclaims on behalf of all other Contributors all warranties and conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose;\nii) effectively excludes on behalf of all other Contributors all liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;\niii) does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients&apos; rights in the Source Code under section 3.2; and\niv) requires any subsequent distribution of the Program by any party to be under a license that satisfies the requirements of this section 3.\n3.2 When the Program is Distributed as Source Code:\na) it must be made available under this Agreement, or if the Program (i) is combined with other material in a separate file or files made available under a Secondary License, and (ii) the initial Contributor attached to the Source Code the notice described in Exhibit A of this Agreement, then the Program may be made available under the terms of such Secondary Licenses, and\nb) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program.\n3.3 Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright, patent, trademark, attribution notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations of liability (&#x2018;notices&#x2019;) contained within the Program from any copy of the Program which they Distribute, provided that Contributors may add their own appropriate notices.\n4.

The intent is that the Copyright Holder maintains some artistic control over the development of that Package while still keeping the Package available as open source and free software.\nYou are always permitted to make arrangements wholly outside of this license directly with the Copyright Holder of a given Package. If the terms of this license do not permit the full use that you propose to make of the Package, you should contact the Copyright Holder and seek a different licensing arrangement.\nDefinitions\n&quot;Copyright Holder&quot; means the individual(s) or organization(s) named in the copyright notice for the entire Package.\n&quot;Contributor&quot; means any party that has contributed code or other material to the Package, in accordance with the Copyright Holder&apos;s procedures.\n&quot;You&quot; and &quot;your&quot; means any person who would like to copy, distribute, or modify the Package.\n&quot;Package&quot; means the collection of files distributed by the Copyright Holder, and derivatives of that collection and/or of those files. A given Package may consist of either the Standard Version, or a Modified Version.\n&quot;Distribute&quot; means providing a copy of the Package or making it accessible to anyone else, or in the case of a company or organization, to others outside of your company or organization.\n&quot;Distributor Fee&quot; means any fee that you charge for Distributing this Package or providing support for this Package to another party. It does not mean licensing fees.\n&quot;Standard Version&quot; refers to the Package if it has not been modified, or has been modified only in ways explicitly requested by the Copyright Holder.\n&quot;Modified Version&quot; means the Package, if it has been changed, and such changes were not explicitly requested by the Copyright Holder.\n&quot;Original License&quot; means this Artistic License as Distributed with the Standard Version of the Package, in its current version or as it may be modified by The Perl Foundation in the future.\n&quot;Source&quot; form means the source code, documentation source, and configuration files for the Package.\n&quot;Compiled&quot; form means the compiled bytecode, object code, binary, or any other form resulting from mechanical transformation or translation of the Source form.\nPermission for Use and Modification Without Distribution\n(1) You are permitted to use the Standard Version and create and use Modified Versions for any purpose without restriction, provided that you do not Distribute the Modified Version.\nPermissions for Redistribution of the Standard Version\n(2) You may Distribute verbatim copies of the Source form of the Standard Version of this Package in any medium without restriction, either gratis or for a Distributor Fee, provided that you duplicate all of the original copyright notices and associated disclaimers. At your discretion, such verbatim copies may or may not include a Compiled form of the Package.\n(3) You may apply any bug fixes, portability changes, and other modifications made available from the Copyright Holder. The resulting Package will still be considered the Standard Version, and as such will be subject to the Original License.\nDistribution of Modified Versions of the Package as Source\n(4) You may Distribute your Modified Version as Source (either gratis or for a Distributor Fee, and with or without a Compiled form of the Modified Version) provided that you clearly document how it differs from the Standard Version, including, but not limited to, documenting any non-standard features, executables, or modules, and provided that you do at least ONE of the following:\n(a) make the Modified Version available to the Copyright Holder of the Standard Version, under the Original License, so that the Copyright Holder may include your modifications in the Standard Version.\n(b) ensure that installation of your Modified Version does not prevent the user installing or running the Standard Version. In addition, the Modified Version must bear a name that is different from the name of the Standard Version.\n(c) allow anyone who receives a copy of the Modified Version to make the Source form of the Modified Version available to others under\n(i) the Original License or\n(ii) a license that permits the licensee to freely copy, modify and redistribute the Modified Version using the same licensing terms that apply to the copy that the licensee received, and requires that the Source form of the Modified Version, and of any works derived from it, be made freely available in that license fees are prohibited but Distributor Fees are allowed.\nDistribution of Compiled Forms of the Standard Version or Modified Versions without the Source\n(5) You may Distribute Compiled forms of the Standard Version without the Source, provided that you include complete instructions on how to get the Source of the Standard Version. Such instructions must be valid at the time of your distribution. If these instructions, at any time while you are carrying out such distribution, become invalid, you must provide new instructions on demand or cease further distribution. If you provide valid instructions or cease distribution within thirty days after you become aware that the instructions are invalid, then you do not forfeit any of your rights under this license.\n(6) You may Distribute a Modified Version in Compiled form without the Source, provided that you comply with Section 4 with respect to the Source of the Modified Version.\nAggregating or Linking the Package\n(7) You may aggregate the Package (either the Standard Version or Modified Version) with other packages and Distribute the resulting aggregation provided that you do not charge a licensing fee for the Package. Distributor Fees are permitted, and licensing fees for other components in the aggregation are permitted. The terms of this license apply to the use and Distribution of the Standard or Modified Versions as included in the aggregation.\n(8) You are permitted to link Modified and Standard Versions with other works, to embed the Package in a larger work of your own, or to build stand-alone binary or bytecode versions of applications that include the Package, and Distribute the result without restriction, provided the result does not expose a direct interface to the Package.\nItems That are Not Considered Part of a Modified Version\n(9) Works (including, but not limited to, modules and scripts) that merely extend or make use of the Package, do not, by themselves, cause the Package to be a Modified Version. In addition, such works are not considered parts of the Package itself, and are not subject to the terms of this license.\nGeneral Provisions\n(10) Any use, modification, and distribution of the Standard or Modified Versions is governed by this Artistic License. By using, modifying or distributing the Package, you accept this license. Do not use, modify, or distribute the Package, if you do not accept this license.\n(11) If your Modified Version has been derived from a Modified Version made by someone other than you, you are nevertheless required to ensure that your Modified Version complies with the requirements of this license.\n(12) This license does not grant you the right to use any trademark, service mark, tradename, or logo of the Copyright Holder.\n(13) This license includes the non-exclusive, worldwide, free-of-charge patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import and otherwise transfer the Package with respect to any patent claims licensable by the Copyright Holder that are necessarily infringed by the Package. If you institute patent litigation (including a cross-claim or counterclaim) against any party alleging that the Package constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then this Artistic License to you shall terminate on the date that such litigation is filed.\n(14) Disclaimer of Warranty: THE PACKAGE IS PROVIDED BY THE COPYRIGHT HOLDER AND CONTRIBUTORS &quot;AS IS&apos; AND WITHOUT ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES.

GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE - Version 2.1\nVersion 2.1, February 1999\nCopyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.\n51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA\nEveryone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies\nof this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\n[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL. It also counts\nas the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence\nthe version number 2.1.]\nPreamble\nThe licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.\nThis license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it. You can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.\nWhen we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do these things.\nTo protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.\nFor example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave you. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. If you link other code with the library, you must provide complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling it. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\nWe protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.\nTo protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that there is no warranty for the free library. Also, if the library is modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know that what they have is not the original version, so that the original author&apos;s reputation will not be affected by problems that might be introduced by others.\nFinally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of any free program. We wish to make sure that a company cannot effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a restrictive license from a patent holder. Therefore, we insist that any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.\nMost GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary GNU General Public License. This license, the GNU Lesser General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and is quite different from the ordinary General Public License. We use this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those libraries into non-free programs.\nWhen a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a combined work, a derivative of the original library. The ordinary General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the entire combination fits its criteria of freedom. The Lesser General Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with the library.\nWe call this license the &quot;Lesser&quot; General Public License because it does Less to protect the user&apos;s freedom than the ordinary General Public License. It also provides other free software developers Less of an advantage over competing non-free programs. These disadvantages are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many libraries. However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain special circumstances.\nFor example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes a de-facto standard. To achieve this, non-free programs must be allowed to use the library. A more frequent case is that a free library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries. In this case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.\nIn other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of free software. For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating system.\nAlthough the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the users&apos; freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run that program using a modified version of the Library.\nThe precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow. Pay close attention to the difference between a &quot;work based on the library&quot; and a &quot;work that uses the library&quot;. The former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must be combined with the library in order to run.\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of this Lesser General Public License (also called &quot;this License&quot;). Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.\nA &quot;library&quot; means a collection of software functions and/or data prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs (which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.\nThe &quot;Library&quot;, below, refers to any such software library or work which has been distributed under these terms. A &quot;work based on the Library&quot; means either the Library or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated straightforwardly into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term &quot;modification&quot;.)\n&quot;Source code&quot; for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. For a library, complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the library.\nActivities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for writing it). Whether that is true depends on what the Library does and what the program that uses the Library does.\n1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library&apos;s complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the Library.\nYou may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\n2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\na) The modified work must itself be a software library.\nb) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\nc) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.\nd) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that, in the event an application does not supply such function or table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful.\n(For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the application. Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any application-supplied function or table used by this function must be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square root function must still compute square roots.)\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the Library.\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this License.\n3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library. To do this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2, instead of to this License. (If a newer version than version 2 of the ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify that version instead if you wish.) Do not make any other change in these notices.\nOnce this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.\nThis option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of the Library into a program that is not a library.\n4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange.\nIf distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to distribute the source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or linked with it, is called a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot;. Such a work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and therefore falls outside the scope of this License.\nHowever, linking a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; with the Library creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it contains portions of the Library), rather than a &quot;work that uses the library&quot;. The executable is therefore covered by this License. Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.\nWhen a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; uses material from a header file that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not. Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library. The threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.\nIf such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative work. (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the Library will still fall under Section 6.)\nOtherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6. Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6, whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.\n6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or link a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; with the Library to produce a work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit modification of the work for the customer&apos;s own use and reverse engineering for debugging such modifications.\nYou must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License. You must supply a copy of this License. If the work during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference directing the user to the copy of this License. Also, you must do one of these things:\na) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked with the Library, with the complete machine-readable &quot;work that uses the Library&quot;, as object code and/or source code, so that the user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified executable containing the modified Library. (It is understood that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application to use the modified definitions.)\nb) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the Library. A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a copy of the library already present on the user&apos;s computer system, rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2) will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if the user installs one, as long as the modified version is interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.\nc) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give the same user the materials specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more than the cost of performing this distribution.\nd) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above specified materials from the same place.\ne) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.\nFor an executable, the required form of the &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; must include any data and utility programs needed for reproducing the executable from it. However, as a special exception, the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable.\nIt may happen that this requirement contradicts the license restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally accompany the operating system. Such a contradiction means you cannot use both them and the Library together in an executable that you distribute.\n7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise permitted, and provided that you do these two things:\na) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities. This must be distributed under the terms of the Sections above.\nb) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.\n8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\n9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Library or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Library or works based on it.\n10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients&apos; exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.\n11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Library at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply, and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution system which is implemented by public license practices. Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License.\n12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License.\n13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and &quot;any later version&quot;, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library does not specify a license version number, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.\n14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these, write to the author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\nNO WARRANTY\n15.

THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE LIBRARY IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\nEND OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\nHow to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries\nIf you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that everyone can redistribute and change. You can do so by permitting redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the ordinary General Public License).\nTo apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library. It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the &quot;copyright&quot; line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\none line to give the library&apos;s name and an idea of what it does.\nCopyright (C) year name of author\nThis library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or\nmodify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public\nLicense as published by the Free Software Foundation; either\nversion 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.\nThis library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\nbut WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\nMERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Defining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode of using an interface provided by the Library.\nA &#x201C;Combined Work&#x201D; is a work produced by combining or linking an Application with the Library. The particular version of the Library with which the Combined Work was made is also called the &#x201C;Linked Version&#x201D;.\nThe &#x201C;Minimal Corresponding Source&#x201D; for a Combined Work means the Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code for portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are based on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.\nThe &#x201C;Corresponding Application Code&#x201D; for a Combined Work means the object code and/or source code for the Application, including any data and utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the Application, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.\n1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.\nYou may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.\n2. Conveying Modified Versions.\nIf you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a facility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application that uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified version:\na) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the function or data, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or\nb) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of this License applicable to that copy.\n3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.\nThe object code form of an Application may incorporate material from a header file that is part of the Library. You may convey such object code under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated material is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure layouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates (ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:\na) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License.\nb) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license document.\n4. Combined Works.\nYou may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that, taken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the portions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse engineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of the following:\na) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License.\nb) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license document.\nc) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.\nd) Do one of the following:\n0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying Corresponding Source.\n1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the Library. A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time a copy of the Library already present on the user&apos;s computer system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked Version.\ne) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise be required to provide such information under section 6 of the GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is necessary to install and execute a modified version of the Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying Corresponding Source.)\n5. Combined Libraries.\nYou may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library side by side in a single library together with other library facilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this License, and convey such a combined library under terms of your choice, if you do both of the following:\na) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities, conveyed under the terms of this License.\nb) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.\n6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.\nThe Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number.

If the Library as you received it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser General Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser General Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.\nIf the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide whether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall apply, that proxy&apos;s public statement of acceptance of any version is permanent authorization for you to choose that version for the Library.\n"},{"id":319,"path":"../..\\..\\..\\..\\..\\xampp\\htdocs\\devonfw.github.io\\website\\pages\\docs/devonfw-ide-support.asciidoc.html#license.asciidoc_gnu-general-public-license---version-2","type":"docs","title":"GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE - Version 2","body":"7.2.9. GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE - Version 2\nVersion 2, June 1991\nCopyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.\n51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301, USA\nEveryone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies\nof this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\nPreamble\nThe licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users. This General Public License applies to most of the Free Software Foundation&apos;s software and to any other program whose authors commit to using it. (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.) You can apply it to your programs, too.\nWhen we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\nTo protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\nFor example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\nWe protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the software.\nAlso, for each author&apos;s protection and ours, we want to make certain that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original authors&apos; reputations.\nFinally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents. We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone&apos;s free use or not licensed at all.\nThe precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms of this General Public License. The &quot;Program&quot;, below, refers to any such program or work, and a &quot;work based on the Program&quot; means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term &quot;modification&quot;.) Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.\nActivities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program (independent of having been made by running the Program). Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.\n1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program&apos;s source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.\nYou may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\n2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\na) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\nb) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.\nc) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run, you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License. (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on the Program is not required to print an announcement.)\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the Program.\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this License.\n3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\na) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\nb) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\nc) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program in object code or executable form with such an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)\nThe source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the executable. However, as a special exception, the source code distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable.\nIf distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\n5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Program or works based on it.\n6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients&apos; exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.\n7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution system, which is implemented by public license practices. Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License.\n8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Program under this License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License.\n9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and &quot;any later version&quot;, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.\n10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\nNO WARRANTY\n11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\nEND OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\nHow to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\nIf you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\nTo do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the &quot;copyright&quot; line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\none line to give the program&apos;s name and an idea of what it does.\nCopyright (C) yyyy name of author\nThis program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or\nmodify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License\nas published by the Free Software Foundation; either version 2\nof the License, or (at your option) any later version.\nThis program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\nbut WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\nMERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

The ownership of the TZ database\nis explained in BCP 175: Procedure for Maintaining the Time Zone\nDatabase section 7.\n# 7. Database Ownership\n#\n# The TZ database itself is not an IETF Contribution or an IETF\n# document. Rather it is a pre-existing and regularly updated work\n# that is in the public domain, and is intended to remain in the\n# public domain. Therefore, BCPs 78 [RFC5378] and 79 [RFC3979] do\n# not apply to the TZ Database or contributions that individuals make\n# to it. Should any claims be made and substantiated against the TZ\n# Database, the organization that is providing the IANA\n# Considerations defined in this RFC, under the memorandum of\n# understanding with the IETF, currently ICANN, may act in accordance\n# with all competent court orders. No ownership claims will be made\n# by ICANN or the IETF Trust on the database or the code. Any person\n# making a contribution to the database or code waives all rights to\n# future claims in that contribution or in the TZ Database.\n6.

If the\nterms of this license do not permit the full use that you propose to\nmake of the Package, you should contact the Copyright Holder and seek\na different licensing arrangement.\nDefinitions\n&quot;Copyright Holder&quot; means the individual(s) or organization(s)\nnamed in the copyright notice for the entire Package.\n&quot;Contributor&quot; means any party that has contributed code or other\nmaterial to the Package, in accordance with the Copyright Holder&apos;s\nprocedures.\n&quot;You&quot; and &quot;your&quot; means any person who would like to copy,\ndistribute, or modify the Package.\n&quot;Package&quot; means the collection of files distributed by the\nCopyright Holder, and derivatives of that collection and/or of\nthose files. A given Package may consist of either the Standard\nVersion, or a Modified Version.\n&quot;Distribute&quot; means providing a copy of the Package or making it\naccessible to anyone else, or in the case of a company or\norganization, to others outside of your company or organization.\n&quot;Distributor Fee&quot; means any fee that you charge for Distributing\nthis Package or providing support for this Package to another\nparty. It does not mean licensing fees.\n&quot;Standard Version&quot; refers to the Package if it has not been\nmodified, or has been modified only in ways explicitly requested\nby the Copyright Holder.\n&quot;Modified Version&quot; means the Package, if it has been changed, and\nsuch changes were not explicitly requested by the Copyright\nHolder.\n&quot;Original License&quot; means this Artistic License as Distributed with\nthe Standard Version of the Package, in its current version or as\nit may be modified by The Perl Foundation in the future.\n&quot;Source&quot; form means the source code, documentation source, and\nconfiguration files for the Package.\n&quot;Compiled&quot; form means the compiled bytecode, object code, binary,\nor any other form resulting from mechanical transformation or\ntranslation of the Source form.\nPermission for Use and Modification Without Distribution\n(1) You are permitted to use the Standard Version and create and use\nModified Versions for any purpose without restriction, provided that\nyou do not Distribute the Modified Version.\nPermissions for Redistribution of the Standard Version\n(2) You may Distribute verbatim copies of the Source form of the\nStandard Version of this Package in any medium without restriction,\neither gratis or for a Distributor Fee, provided that you duplicate\nall of the original copyright notices and associated disclaimers. At\nyour discretion, such verbatim copies may or may not include a\nCompiled form of the Package.\n(3) You may apply any bug fixes, portability changes, and other\nmodifications made available from the Copyright Holder. The resulting\nPackage will still be considered the Standard Version, and as such\nwill be subject to the Original License.\nDistribution of Modified Versions of the Package as Source\n(4) You may Distribute your Modified Version as Source (either gratis\nor for a Distributor Fee, and with or without a Compiled form of the\nModified Version) provided that you clearly document how it differs\nfrom the Standard Version, including, but not limited to, documenting\nany non-standard features, executables, or modules, and provided that\nyou do at least ONE of the following:\n(a) make the Modified Version available to the Copyright Holder\nof the Standard Version, under the Original License, so that the\nCopyright Holder may include your modifications in the Standard\nVersion.\n(b) ensure that installation of your Modified Version does not\nprevent the user installing or running the Standard Version. In\naddition, the Modified Version must bear a name that is different\nfrom the name of the Standard Version.\n(c) allow anyone who receives a copy of the Modified Version to\nmake the Source form of the Modified Version available to others\nunder\n(i) the Original License or\n(ii) a license that permits the licensee to freely copy,\nmodify and redistribute the Modified Version using the same\nlicensing terms that apply to the copy that the licensee\nreceived, and requires that the Source form of the Modified\nVersion, and of any works derived from it, be made freely\navailable in that license fees are prohibited but Distributor\nFees are allowed.\nDistribution of Compiled Forms of the Standard Version\nor Modified Versions without the Source\n(5) You may Distribute Compiled forms of the Standard Version without\nthe Source, provided that you include complete instructions on how to\nget the Source of the Standard Version.

Distributor Fees are permitted, and licensing fees for other\ncomponents in the aggregation are permitted. The terms of this license\napply to the use and Distribution of the Standard or Modified Versions\nas included in the aggregation.\n(8) You are permitted to link Modified and Standard Versions with\nother works, to embed the Package in a larger work of your own, or to\nbuild stand-alone binary or bytecode versions of applications that\ninclude the Package, and Distribute the result without restriction,\nprovided the result does not expose a direct interface to the Package.\nItems That are Not Considered Part of a Modified Version\n(9) Works (including, but not limited to, modules and scripts) that\nmerely extend or make use of the Package, do not, by themselves, cause\nthe Package to be a Modified Version. In addition, such works are not\nconsidered parts of the Package itself, and are not subject to the\nterms of this license.\nGeneral Provisions\n(10) Any use, modification, and distribution of the Standard or\nModified Versions is governed by this Artistic License. By using,\nmodifying or distributing the Package, you accept this license. Do not\nuse, modify, or distribute the Package, if you do not accept this\nlicense.\n(11) If your Modified Version has been derived from a Modified\nVersion made by someone other than you, you are nevertheless required\nto ensure that your Modified Version complies with the requirements of\nthis license.\n(12) This license does not grant you the right to use any trademark,\nservice mark, tradename, or logo of the Copyright Holder.\n(13) This license includes the non-exclusive, worldwide,\nfree-of-charge patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell,\nsell, import and otherwise transfer the Package with respect to any\npatent claims licensable by the Copyright Holder that are necessarily\ninfringed by the Package. If you institute patent litigation\n(including a cross-claim or counterclaim) against any party alleging\nthat the Package constitutes direct or contributory patent\ninfringement, then this Artistic License to you shall terminate on the\ndate that such litigation is filed.\n(14) Disclaimer of Warranty:\nTHE PACKAGE IS PROVIDED BY THE COPYRIGHT HOLDER AND CONTRIBUTORS &quot;AS\nIS&apos; AND WITHOUT ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES.

Developer\nAs a developer you are supported to setup your IDE automated and fast while you can have a nice cup of coffee (after you provided settings-URL and accepted the license).\nYou only need the settings URL from your devonfw-ide admin.\nExperienced developers can directly call setup &#xAB;settings-URL&#xBB;.\nOtherwise if you just call setup (e.g. by double-clicking it), you can enter it when you are prompted for Settings URL (using copy&amp;paste to avoid typos).\nNote: devonfw-ide supports autocompletion (since 2021.04.001). Currently this only works in bash (on windows use git bash). Simply type devon and hit [Tab] to get completion.\nUpdate\nTo update your IDE (if instructed by your admin), you only need to run the following command:\ndevon ide update\nPlease note that windows is using file-locking what can have ugly side-effects.\nTo be safe, you should have your IDE tools shut down before invoking the above update command.\nE.g. if a tool needs to be updated, the old installation folder will be moved to a backup and the new version is installed on top.\nIf there are windows file locks in place this can fail and mess up things.\nYou can still delete the according installation from your software folder and rerun devon ide update if you ran into this error.\nWorking with multiple workspaces\nIf you are working on different branches in parallel you typically want to use multiple workspaces.\nGo to the workspaces folder in your ${DEVON_IDE_HOME} and create a new folder with the name of your choice (e.g. release2.1).\nCheck out (git clone &#x2026;&#x200B;) the according projects and branch into that workspace folder.\nOpen a shell in that new workspace folder (cd to it) and according to your IDE run e.g. eclipse, vscode, or intellij to create your workspace and launch the IDE. You can also add the parameter create-script to the IDE commandlet in order to create a launch-script for your IDE.\nYou can have multiple instances of eclipse running for each workspace in parallel. To distinguish these instances you will find the workspace name in the title of eclipse.\n"},{"id":326,"path":"../..\\..\\..\\..\\..\\xampp\\htdocs\\devonfw.github.io\\website\\pages\\docs/devonfw-ide-usage.asciidoc.html#usage.asciidoc_admin","type":"docs","title":"Admin","body":"5.1.2. Admin\nYou can easily customize and configure devonfw-ide for the requirements of your project.\nIn order to do so, you need to create your own project-specific settings git repository and provide the URL to all developers for the setup.\nWith tools such as gitlab, bitbucket or github every developer can easily propose changes and improvements.\nHowever, we suggest that one team member is responsible to ensure that everything stays consistent and works.\nWe will call this person the devonfw-ide admin of your project.\nThe following are the suggested step-by-step instructions how an ide-admin should prepare devonfw-ide for his new project:\nFork ide-settings to a git repository specific for your project (e.g. a new project in the gitlab of your production-line instance). In case you are using github, all you need to do is use the Fork button. In other cases simply create a new and empty git repository and clone this to your machine. Then add the default ide-settings as origin, fetch and pull from it:\ngit remote add upstream https://github.com/devonfw/ide-settings.git\ngit fetch upstream\ngit pull upstream master\ngit push\nNow you should have a full fork as a copy of the settings git repo with all its history that is ready for upstream merges.\nStudy the structure of this git repository to understand where to find which configuration.\nStudy the configuration and understand that general settings can be tweaked in the toplevel devon.properties file of your settings git repository.\nConfigure the tools and their versions for your project:\nDEVON_IDE_TOOLS=(java mvn eclipse)\nECLIPSE_VERSION=2020-06\n# use e.g. 8u242b08 for Java 8\n#JAVA_VERSION=8u242b08\nJAVA_VERSION=11.0.5_10\nMAVEN_VERSION=3.6.2\nThis way you will take over control of the tools and their versions for every developer in your project team and ensure that things get reproducible.\nIn case you need a proprietary or unsupported tool, you can study how to include custom tools.\nIn case you have very restrictive policies about downloading tools from the internet, you can create and configure a software repository for your project or company.\nSome of the tools (espcially the actual IDEs) allow extensions via plugins. You can customize them to your needs for eclipse, VS code, or intelliJ.\nIn your settings git repository you will find a projects folder. Here you will find configurations files for every git project relevant for your actual project. Feel free to create new projects for your needs and delete the devonfw specific default projects. The projects documentation will explain you how to do this.\nFor every IDE you will also find an according folder in your settings git repository. Here are the individual configuration settings for that IDE. You can change them by directly editing the according configuration files directly with a text-editor in your settings git repository. However, this is a really complex way and will take you a lot of time to find the right file and property to tweak for your actual need. Instead we suggest to study\nhow to customize IDE specific settings.\nYou may also create new sub-folders in your settings git repository and put individual things according to your needs. E.g. you could add scripts for greasemonkey or tampermonkey, as well as scripts for your database or whatever may be useful and worth to share in your team. However, to share and maintain knowledge we recommend to use a wiki instead.\nYou may want to customize the Eclipse spellchecker dictionary for your project and your language.\nAll described in the above steps (except the first one) can be used to manage and update the configuration during the project lifecycle.\nHowever, when you have done changes especially in a larger project, please consider the following best-practices to avoid that a large teams gets blocked by a non-functional IDE:\nCommit your changes to a feature-branch.\nFirst test the changes yourself.\nIf all works as expected, pick a pilot user of the team to test the changes from the feature branch (go to settings folder, git fetch, git checkout -t origin/feature/&#xAB;name&#xBB;, devon ide update).\nOnly after that works well for a couple of days, inform the entire team to update.\nAnnounce changes to your team\nIn order to roll out the perfectly configured devonfw-ide to your project initially or when new members join, you only have to provide the Settings URL to the developers of your team.\nAfter you changed and tested your settings git repository (main branch), you only need to announce this to your developers (e.g. via email or some communication tool) so that they will can devon ide update and automatically get up-to-date with the latest changes (see update).\nIn case you want to go to a new version of devonfw-ide itself, developers have to call devon ide update scripts.\n"},{"id":327,"path":"../..\\..\\..\\..\\..\\xampp\\htdocs\\devonfw.github.io\\website\\pages\\docs/devonfw-ide-usage.asciidoc.html#configuration.asciidoc","type":"docs","title":"Configuration","body":"5.2.

You can choose betwenn &apos;java&apos; for standard edition or &apos;jee&apos; for enterprise edition.\nplugins\nTo be productive with Eclipse you need plugins. Of course devonfw-ide can automate this for your:\nIn your settings git repository create a folder eclipse/plugins (click on this link to see more examples and see which plugins come by default).\nHere you can create a properties file for each plugin. This is an example tmterminal.properties:\nplugin_url=http://download.eclipse.org/tm/terminal/marketplace\nplugin_id=org.eclipse.tm.terminal.feature.feature.group,org.eclipse.tm.terminal.view.feature.feature.group,org.eclipse.tm.terminal.control.feature.feature.group,org.eclipse.tm.terminal.connector.ssh.feature.feature.group,org.eclipse.tm.terminal.connector.telnet.feature.feature.group\nplugin_active=true\nThe variables are defined as follows:\nplugin_url defines the URL of the Eclipse update site of the plugin\nplugin_id defines the feature group ID(s) to install. To install multiple features/plugins provide a coma-separated list of IDs. If you want to customize devonfw-ide with new plugins you can first install them manually and then go to About Eclipse &gt; Installation Details then you can filter for your newly installed plugin and find the values in the Id column. Copy &amp; paste them from here to make up your own custom config.\nplugin_active is an optional parameter. If it is true (default) the plugin will be installed automatically during the project setup for all developers in your team. Otherwise, developers can still install the plugin manually via devon eclipse add-plugin &#xAB;plugin-name&#xBB; from the config file settings/eclipse/plugins/&#xAB;plugin-name&#xBB;.properties. See the settings/eclipse/plugins folder for possible values of &#xAB;plugin-name&#xBB;.\nIn general you should try to stick with the configuration pre-defined by your project. But some plugins may be considered as personal flavor and are typically not predefined by the project config. This e.g. applies for devstyle that allows a real dark mode for eclipse and tunes the theming and layout of Eclipse in general. Such plugins should be shipped with your settings as described above with plugin_active=false allowing you to easily install it manually.\nAs the maintainer of the settings for your project you should avoid to ship too many plugins that may waste resources but are not used by every developer. By configuring additional plugins with plugin_active=false you can give your developers the freedom to install some additional plugins easily.\nlegacy plugin config\nFor downward compatibility we still support the deprecated legacy configuration if the folder settings/eclipse/plugins does not exist:\nThe project configuration typically defines the plugins that will be installed via ECLIPSE_PLUGINS variable. Otherwise defaults from this eclipse commandlet will apply.\nBe aware that this comes at your own risk and sometimes plugins can conflict and break your IDE.\nHere is an example how a project can configure the plugins in its devon.properties inside the settings:\nECLIPSE_PLUGINS=(&quot;AnyEditTools.feature.group&quot; &quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iloveeclipse/plugins/latest/&quot; &quot;com.ess.regexutil.feature.group&quot; &quot;http://regex-util.sourceforge.net/update/&quot;)\nFor the above listed plugins you can also use the short form:\nECLIPSE_PLUGINS=(&quot;anyedit&quot; &quot;&quot; &quot;regexutil&quot; &quot;&quot;)\nOf course you may also mix plugin IDs with fully qualified plugins.\ndictionary\nEclipse already comes with a buid-in spellchecker. This is very helpful when writing comments. The default settings of devonfw-ide ship with a project specific dictionary file and according configurations to enable spellchecking and configuring this dictionary.\nWhen typing JavaDoc, inline comments or other texts the spellchecker will underline unknown words in red.\nIf your cursor is located at such a word you can hit [Ctrl][1] to get a context menu with additional options.\nThere you can either choose similar correct words to correct a typo or you may even add the word (maybe a new buisness term) to your local dictionary.\nIn the latter case, you should commit the changes to your settings so that it will be available to your entire team.\nFor further details about comitting changes to the settings please consult the admin usage.\nnon-english dictionary\nIn case your project has to write documentation or text in languages other than English, you might want to prefill your project dictionary for that language.\nHere we collect a list of such dictionaries that you can download and merge into your project dictionary:\nGerman: https://sourceforge.net/projects/germandict/ (has to be converted to UTF-8 e.g. with Notepad++ via Encoding &gt; Convert to UTF-8)\n"},{"id":335,"path":"../..\\..\\..\\..\\..\\xampp\\htdocs\\devonfw.github.io\\website\\pages\\docs/devonfw-ide-usage.asciidoc.html#gradle.asciidoc","type":"docs","title":"gradle","body":"5.4.5. gradle\nThe gradle commandlet allows to install, configure, and launch gradle.

It is recommended to run the setup script in the top-level directory ($DEVON_IDE_HOME). However, in case you want to skip some system specific integrations, you may also run this command directly instead. The setup only needs to be called once after a new devonfw-ide instance has been created. It will follow this process:\ninstall the devon command on your system (if not already installed).\nclone the settings (you may provide a git URL directly as argument or you will be prompted for it).\ninstall all required software from DEVON_IDE_TOOLS variable (if not already installed).\nconfigure all these tools\ncreate IDE launch scripts\nperform OS specific system integration such as WindowsExplorer integration (only done from setup script and not from devon ide setup)\nupdate\nRun devon ide update to update your devonfw-ide. This will check for updates and install them automatically.\nThe optinal extra argument (&#xAB;package&#xBB;) behaves as follows:\nscripts: check if a new version of devonfw-ide-scripts is available. If so it will be downloaded and installed. As Windows is using file-locks, it is tricky to update a script while it is executed. Therefore, we update the scripts folder as an async background task and have to abort further processing at this point on windows as a workaround.\nsettings: update the settings (git pull).\nsoftware: update the software (e.g. if versions have changed via scripts or settings update).\nprojects: update the projects (checkout and import repositories into workspace/IDEs).\nall: do all the above sequentially.\nnone: settings and software are updated by default if no extra argument is given. This is the regular usage for project developers. Only perform an update of scripts when you are requested to do so by your technical lead. Bigger projects especially need to test updates before rolling them out to the entire team. If developers always updated the latest release of the scripts which is released globally, some project functionality would break causing problems and extra efforts in the teams.\nIn order to update to a specific version of scripts an explicit version can be specified after the additional to argument:\ndevon ide update scripts to 3.1.99\nThe above example will update to the exact version 3.1.99 no matter if this is an upgrade or a downgrade of your current installed version.\nIf you just use devon ide update scripts then the latest available version will be installed. In larger teams it is recommended to communicate exact version updates to avoid that a new release can interfere and break anything. Therefore, some pilot user will test a new version for the entire team and, only after a successful test, they will communicate to the team to update to that exact version by providing the complete command as in the above example.\nuninstall\nWe hope you love devonfw-ide. However, if you don&#x2019;t and want to get rid of it entirely and completely remove all integrations, you can use this command:\ndevon ide uninstall\nThis will remove devonfw-ide from all central places of your OS (user home directory such as scripts, .devon, .bashrc, as well as windows registry, etc.).\nHowever, it will not remove your current installations (or shared software folder). So after running this uninstall, simply remove your DEVON_IDE_HOME directory of all devonfw-ide installations and potential shared software folder. You may also want to clean up your ~/Downloads directory from files downloaded by devonfw-ide.

Of course devonfw-ide can automate this for your:\nIn your settings git repository create a folder vscode/plugins (click this link to see more examples and see which plugins come by default).\nHere you can create a properties file for each plugin. This is an example devonfw-extension-pack.properties:\nplugin_id=devonfw.devonfw-extension-pack\nplugin_active=true\nThe variables are defined as following:\nplugin_id defines the unique ID of the plugin to install. If you want to customize devonfw-ide with new plugins click on Extensions at the bottom of the left navigation icon bar in VS code. Then use the search to find the plugin of your choice. If you click on it the plugin ID is displayed in grey beside the official title at the top of the plugin details page. Copy &amp; paste the ID from here to make up your own custom config.\nplugin_active is an optional parameter. If it is true (default) the plugin will be installed automatically during the project setup for all developers in your team. Otherwise developers can still install the plugin manually via devon vscode add-plugin &#xAB;plugin-name&#xBB; from the config file settings/vscode/plugins/&#xAB;plugin-name&#xBB;.properties. See the settings/vscode/plugins folder for possible values of &#xAB;plugin-name&#xBB;.\nIn general you should try to stick with the configuration pre-defined by your project. But some plugins may be considered as personal flavor and are typically not predefined by the project config. Such plugins should be shipped with your settings as described above with plugin_active=false allowing you to easily install it manually. Surely, you can easily add plugins via the UI of VS code. However, be aware that some plugins may collect sensitive data or could introduce other vulnerabilities. So consider the governance of your project and talk to your technical lead before installing additional plugins that are not pre-defined in your settings.\nAs maintainer of the settings for your project you should avoid to ship too many plugins that may waste resources but are not used by every developer. By configuring additional plugins with plugin_active=false you can give your developers the freedom to install some additional plugins easily.\ncleaning plugins on update\nIf you want to striclty manage the plugins for VS code in your project, you can create or edit the file settings/vscode/plugins in your settings and add this variable:\nclean_plugins_on_update=true\nThis will wipe all plugins when an update of VS code is performed (e.g. via devon ide update) and reinstall all configured plugins. While this gives you more control over the governance of the plugins and allows to remove a plugin later during project lifecycle.

There are copied to the devonfw-ide installation during setup (if no such file already exists). In this way the settings repository can provide reasonable defaults but allows the user to take over control and customize to his personal needs (e.g. .m2/settings.xml).\nOther configurations need to be imported manually. To avoid manual steps and simplify use we try to automate as much as possible. This currently applies to sonarqube profiles but will be automated with sonar-devon4j-plugin in the future.\nFor tools with complex configuration structures like eclipse, intellij, or vscode we provide a smart mechanism via our configurator.\nCustomize Settings\nYou can easily customize these settings for the requirements of your project. We suggest that one team member is responsible to ensure that everything stays consistent and works.\nYou may also create new sub-folders in settings and put individual items according to your needs.

However, some projects may need specific tools or tool versions that are not publicly available.\nIn such case, they can create their own software repository (e.g. in a VPN) and configure the base URL of it via DEVON_SOFTWARE_REPOSITORY variable.\nThen, devonfw-ide will download all software from this repository only instead of the default public download URLs.\nThis repository (URL) should be accessible within your network via HTTPS (or HTTP) and without any authentication.\nThe repository needs to have the following structure:\n${DEVON_SOFTWARE_REPOSITORY}/&#xAB;tool&#xBB;/&#xAB;version&#xBB;/&#xAB;tool&#xBB;-&#xAB;version&#xBB;[-&#xAB;os&#xBB;].tgz\nSo for every tool &#xAB;tool&#xBB; (java, maven, vscode, eclipse, etc.) you need to provide a folder in your repository.\nWithin this folder for every supported version &#xAB;version&#xBB; you need a subfolder.\nThis subfolder needs to contain the tool in that version for every operating system &#xAB;os&#xBB; (windows, linux, or mac - omitted if platform independent, e.g. for maven).\nShared\nBy default, each installation of devonfw-ide has its own physical installations of the required tools in the desired versions stored in its local software folder.\nWhile this is great for isolation of devonfw-ide installations and to prevent side-effects, it can cause a huge waste of disc resources in case you are having many installations of devonfw-ide.\nIf you are a power-user of devonfw-ide with more then ten or even up to hundreds of installations on your machine, you might love to share installations of a software tool in a particular version between multiple devonfw-ide installations.\nCaution\nIf you use this power-feature you are taking responsibility for side-effects and should not expect support. Also if you are using Windows please read Symlinks in Windows and make your mind if you really want to do so. You might also use this hint and maintain it manually without enabling the following feature.\nIn order to do so, you only need to configure the variable DEVON_SOFTWARE_PATH in your ~/devon.properties pointing to an existing directory on your disc (e.g. /projects/software or C:\\projects\\software).\nThen devonfw-ide will install required software into ${DEVON_SOFTWARE_PATH}/${software_name}/${software_version} as needed and create a symbolic link to it in ${DEVON_IDE_HOME}/software/${software_name}.\nAs a benefit, another devonfw-ide installation will using the same software with the same version can re-use the existing installation and only needs to create the symbolic link. No more waste of having many identical JDK installations on your disc.\nAs a drawback, you need to be aware that specific tools may be &quot;manipulated&quot; after installation.\nThe most common case is that a tool allows to install plugins or extensions such as all IDEs do. Such &quot;manipulations&quot; will cause side-effects between the different devonfw-ide installations sharing the same version of that tool.\nWhile this can also be a benefit it may also cause trouble.\nIf you have a sensitive project that should not be affected by such side-effects, you may again override the DEVON_SOFTWARE_PATH variable to the empty value in your ${DEVON_IDE_HOME}/conf/devon.properties of that sensitive installation:\nDEVON_SOFTWARE_PATH=\nThis will disable this feature particularly for that specific sensitive devonfw-ide installation but let you use it for all other ones.\nCustom\nIn some cases, a project might need a (proprietary) tool(s) that (are) not supported by devonfw-ide. A very simple solution is to get a release of devonfw-ide and add the tool(s) to the software folder and then distribute this modified release to your team. However, this has several drawbacks as you then have a fork of devonfw-ide all will loose your tool(s) when updating to a new release.\nAs a solution for this need, devonfw-ide let&#x2019;s you configure custom tools via the DEVON_IDE_CUSTOM_TOOLS variable. It can be defined in devon.properties of your settings git repository as an array of the custom tools you need to add.\nEach entry applies:\nIt needs to have the form &#xAB;tool&#xBB;:&#xAB;version&#xBB;[:all][:&#xAB;repository-url&#xBB;]\nThe first entry must have the &#xAB;repository-url&#xBB; included which is used as default\nFurther entries will inherit this default if omitted\nThis URL is used in the same way as described above for a software repository.\nThe DEVON_SOFTWARE_REPOSITORY variable is ignored by this feature.\nThe optional infix :all is used to indicate that the tool is platform independent. Otherwise, an OS specific infix is appended to the URL file to download for your platform (windows, linux, or mac).\nAs an example, we define it in ${DEVON_IDE_HOME}/settings/devon.properties:\nDEVON_IDE_CUSTOM_TOOLS=(jboss-eap:7.1.4.GA:all:https://host.tld/projects/my-project firefox:70.0.1)\nThis will download and extract the following content to your software folder:\nhttps://host.tld/projects/my-project/jboss-eap/7.1.4.GA/jboss-eap-7.1.4.GA.tgz\nhttps://host.tld/projects/my-project/firefox/70.0.1/firefox-70.0.1-windows.tgz\nPlease note that if you are not using windows, the -windows suffix will be -mac or -linux.\n"},{"id":357,"path":"../..\\..\\..\\..\\..\\xampp\\htdocs\\devonfw.github.io\\website\\pages\\docs/devonfw-ide-usage.asciidoc.html#system.asciidoc","type":"docs","title":"system","body":"5.5.6. system\nThe system folder contains documentation and solutions for operation system specific integration.

Also, you are free to create any number of additional workspace folders named as you like (e.g. test, release, testing, my-sub-project, etc.). Using multiple workspaces is especially relevant for Eclipse as each workspace has its own Eclipse runtime instance and configuration.\nWithin the workspace folder (e.g. workspaces/main) you are again free to create sub-folders for (sub-)projects according to your needs.

Custom Tools\ndevonfw-ide\nThe devonfw-ide is not one monolithic program that is installed with a traditional executable; rather it&#x2019;s a collection of scripts which are invoked via command line to automate several, repetetive development tasks. These scripts then interact with other tools, frameworks, and third-party IDEs to streamline the development workflow.\nThe advantage of this approach is, that you can have as many instances of the devonfw-ide on your machine as you need&#x2009;&#x2014;&#x2009;for different projects with different tools, tool versions and configurations. No need for a physical installation and no tweaking of your operating system required!\nInstances of the devonfw-ide do not interfere with each other, nor with other installed software. The package size of the devonfw-ide is initally very small, the setup is simple, and the included software is portable.\nIDEs\nIt supports the following IDEs:\nEclipse\nVisual Studio Code\nIntelliJ IDEA\nPlatforms\nIt supports the following platforms:\nJava (see also devon4j)\nNode.js (see also devon4node)\nAngular (see also devon4ng)\nC# (see also devon4net)\nBuild-Systems\nIt supports the following build-systems:\nMaven\nNPM\nGradle\nTip\nOther IDEs, platforms, or tools can easily be integrated as commandlets.\nCobiGen\nCobiGen is a code generator included in the devonfw-ide, that allows users to generate the project structure and large parts of the application component code. This saves a lot of time, which is usually wasted on repetitive engineering tasks and/or writing boilerplate code.\nFollowing the same philosophy as the devonfw-ide, CobiGen bundles a new command line interface (CLI), that enables the generation of code using only a few commands. This approach also allows us to decouple CobiGen from Eclipse and use it alongside VS Code or IntelliJ IDEA.\n"},{"id":388,"path":"../..\\..\\..\\..\\..\\xampp\\htdocs\\devonfw.github.io\\website\\pages\\docs/getting-started.asciidoc_introduction.html#introduction-why-should-i-use-devonfw.asciidoc","type":"docs","title":"Why should I use devonfw?","body":"1.2.

XE\nFor local development you should setup Oracle XE (eXpress Edition).\nYou need an oracle account, then you can download it from here.\nThe most comfortable way to run it as needed is using docker. You can build your own docker image from the downloaded RPM using the instructions and dockerfile from oracle. The following commands will build and start Oracle XE 18.4.0 on your machine:\ngit clone https://github.com/oracle/docker-images.git\ncd docker-images/OracleDatabase/SingleInstance/dockerfiles\n./buildDockerImage.sh -x -v 18.4.0\ndocker run -d -p 1521:1521 --name=oracle-xe --restart=always -e ORACLE_PWD=&#xAB;my-sys-pwd&#xBB; oracle/database:18.4.0-xe\nPlease note that the buildDockerImage.sh will take a long time. Further after docker run has passed you need to give time for your new container to startup and setup the Oracle XE DB. So be patient and give it some time.\n(In case the build of the docker-image fails reproducibly and you want to give up with the Dockerfiles from Oracle you can also try this inofficial docker-oracle-xe solution. However, this is not recommended and may lead to other problems.).\nStarting with XE 18c you need to be aware that oracle introduced a multi-tenant architecture. Hence xe refers to the root CDB while you typically want to connect to the PDB (pluggable database) and XE ships with exactly one of this called xepdb1.\nTo connect to your local XE database you need to use xepdb1 as the Service Name (typically in SQL Developer). The hostname should be localhost and the port is by default 1521 if you did not remap it with docker to something else.\nIn order to create schema users, use sys as Username and change Role to SYSDBA.\nHint: If you happen to end up connected to xe instead of xepdb1 in some case (e.g. in sqlplus), you may switch using this statement:\nALTER SESSION SET CONTAINER = XEPDB1;\nThe JDBC URL for your Oracle XE Database is:\njdbc:oracle:thin:@//localhost:1521/xepdb1\nTo locally connect as sysdba without password use the following command (connect / as sysdba is not working anymore):\nsqlplus sys/Oracle18@localhost/XE as sysdba\n"},{"id":437,"path":"../..\\..\\..\\..\\..\\xampp\\htdocs\\devonfw.github.io\\website\\pages\\docs/guide-oracle.asciidoc.html#guide-oracle.asciidoc_driver","type":"docs","title":"Driver","body":"38.2.

If you are using Oracle RDBMS and do not plan to change that you can use the Oracle specific connection pool &quot;Universal Connection Pool (UCP)&quot; that is perfectly integrated with the Oracle driver. According to the documentation, UCP can even be used to manage third party data sources.\nLike the JDBC driver also the UCP is available in maven central. The dependency should look like this:\n&lt;dependency&gt;\n&lt;groupId&gt;com.oracle.database.jdbc&lt;/groupId&gt;\n&lt;artifactId&gt;ucp&lt;/artifactId&gt;\n&lt;version&gt;${oracle.ucp.version}&lt;/version&gt;\n&lt;/dependency&gt;\nwith property oracle.ucp.version analogue to oracle.driver.version.\nConfiguration is done via application.properties like this (example):\n#Oracle UCP\n# Datasource for accessing the database\nspring.datasource.url=jdbc:oracle:thin:@192.168.58.2:1521:xe\nspring.jpa.database-platform=org.hibernate.dialect.Oracle12cDialect\nspring.datasource.user=MyUser\nspring.datasource.password=ThisIsMyPassword\nspring.datasource.driver-class-name=oracle.jdbc.OracleDriver\nspring.datasource.schema=MySchema\nspring.datasource.type=oracle.ucp.jdbc.PoolDataSourceImpl\nspring.datasource.factory=oracle.ucp.jdbc.PoolDataSourceFactory\nspring.datasource.factory-method=getPoolDataSource\nspring.datasource.connectionFactoryClassName=oracle.jdbc.pool.OracleDataSource\nspring.datasource.validateConnectionOnBorrow=true\nspring.datasource.connectionPoolName=MyPool\nspring.datasource.jmx-enabled=true\n# Optional: Set the log level to INTERNAL_ERROR, SEVERE, WARNING, INFO, CONFIG, FINE, TRACE_10, FINER, TRACE_20, TRACE_30, or FINEST\n# logging.level.oracle.ucp=INTERNAL_ERROR\n# Optional: activate tracing\n# logging.level.oracle.ucp.jdbc.oracle.OracleUniversalPooledConnection=TRACE\n#Optional: Configures pool size manually\n#spring.datasource.minPoolSize=10\n#spring.datasource.maxPoolSize=40\n#spring.datasource.initialPoolSize=20\nResources: FAQ, developer&#x2019;s guide, Java API Reference.

Also, Oracle has a strange bug fixing / patching policy: instead of producing a fixed version 12.1.0.3 or 12.1.0.2.x, Oracle publishes collections of *.class files that must be manually patched into the ucp.jar!

Messaging\nIn case you want to do messaging based on JMS you might consider the Oracle JMS also called Oracle Streams Advanced Queuing, or Oracle Advanced Queuing, or OAQ or AQ for short. OAQ is a JMS provider based on the Oracle RDBMS and included in the DB product for no extra fee. OAQ has some features that exceed the JMS standard like a retention time (i.e. a built-in backup mechanism that allows to make messages &quot;unread&quot; within a configurable period of time so that these messages do not have to be resent by the sending application). Also, OAQ messages are stored in relational tables so they can easily be observed by a test driver in a system test scenario.\nCapgemini has used the Spring Data JDBC Extension in order to process OAQ messages within the same technical transaction as the resulting Oracle RDBMS data changes without using 2PC and an XA-compliant transaction manager - which is not available out of the box in Tomcat. This is possible only due to the fact that OAQ queues and RDBMS tables actually reside in the same database. However, this is higher magic and should only be tried if high transaction rates must be achieved by avoiding 2PC.\n"},{"id":440,"path":"../..\\..\\..\\..\\..\\xampp\\htdocs\\devonfw.github.io\\website\\pages\\docs/guide-oracle.asciidoc.html#guide-oracle.asciidoc_general-notes-on-the-use-of-oracle-products","type":"docs","title":"General Notes on the use of Oracle products","body":"38.5. General Notes on the use of Oracle products\nOracle sells commercial products and receives licence fees for them. This includes access to a support organization. Therefore, at an early stage of your project, prepare for contacting oracle support in case of technical problems. You will need the Oracle support ID of your customer [i.e. the legal entity who pays the licence fee and runs the RDBMS] and your customer must grant you permission to use it in a service request - it is not legal to use a your own support ID in a customer-related project. Your customer pays for that service anyway, so use it in case of a problem!\nSoftware components like the JDBC driver or the UCP may be available without a registration or fee but they are protected by the Oracle Technology Network (OTN) License Agreement. The most important aspect of this licence agreement is the fact that an IT service provider is not allowed to simply download the Oracle software component, bundle it in a software artefact and deliver it to the customer. Instead, the Oracle software component must be (from a legal point of view) provided by the owner of the Oracle DB licence (i.e. your customer). This can be achieved in two ways: Advise your customer to install the Oracle software component in the application server as a library that can be used by your custom built system. Or, in cases where this is not feasible, e.g. in a OpenShift environment where the IT service provider delivers complete Docker images, you must advise your customer to (legally, i.e. documented in a written form) provide the Oracle software component to you, i.e. you don&#x2019;t download the software component from the Oracle site but receive it from your customer.\n"},{"id":441,"path":"../..\\..\\..\\..\\..\\xampp\\htdocs\\devonfw.github.io\\website\\pages\\docs/guide-oracle.asciidoc.html#guide-oracle.asciidoc_fix-for-tns-listener-issues","type":"docs","title":"Fix for TNS-Listener issues","body":"38.6.

CICDGEN SCHEMATICS\nWe use angular schematics to create and update an existing devonfw project in order to adapt it to a CICD environment.

Until version 1.5 the behaviour in these cases was to throw an error and not create/modify any file. Since version 1.6 you can choose what to do in case of conflict. In this page we will explain who to choose one merge strategy and how it works.\nChoose a merge strategy\nTo choose a merge strategy, you must pass to cicdgen the merge parameter followed by the name of the strategy. The strategies available are: error, keep, override, combine.\nExample:\n$ cicdgen generate devon4j --merge keep\nMerge strategies\nerror: The error strategy is the same as until version 1.5, throwing an error and do not create/modify any file. This is the default value, if you do not pass the merge parameter this value will be taken.\nkeep: The keep strategy will keep the actual content of your files in case of conflict. If there is no conflict, the file will be created with the new content.\noverride: The override strategy will override your current files, without throwing any error, and create a new ones with the new content. If there is no conflict, the file will be created with the new content.\ncombine: The combine strategy will create a new file combining the current content with the new content. In order to combine both files, it will apply a diff algorithm and it will show the conflicts in the same way that git does. If there is no conflict, the file will be created with the new content.\nBy resolving the conflicts in the same way as git, you can use the same tools in order to solve them. For example, you can use VSCode:\nExamples:\nkeep\nCurrent file:\nLine 1\nLine 2\nLine 3\nLine 4\nNew file:\nLine 5\nLine 2\nLine 3\nLine 4\nThe result will be:\nLine 1\nLine 2\nLine 3\nLine 4\noverride\nCurrent file:\nLine 1\nLine 2\nLine 3\nLine 4\nNew file:\nLine 5\nLine 2\nLine 3\nLine 4\nThe result will be:\nLine 5\nLine 2\nLine 3\nLine 4\ncombine\nCurrent file:\nLine 1\nLine 2\nLine 3\nLine 4\nNew file:\nLine 5\nLine 2\nLine 3\nLine 4\nThe result will be:\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; HEAD\nLine 1\n=======\nLine 5\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; new_content\nLine 2\nLine 3\nLine 4\n"},{"id":469,"path":"../..\\..\\..\\..\\..\\xampp\\htdocs\\devonfw.github.io\\website\\pages\\docs/master-cicdgen.asciidoc_cicdgen-schematics.html#devon4j-schematic.asciidoc_devon4j-schematic","type":"docs","title":"devon4j schematic","body":"63.2. devon4j schematic\nWith the cicdgen generate devon4j command you can generate some files required for CICD.

Context Configuration\nThe context configuration (context.xml) always has the following root structure:\nListing 97. Context Configuration\n&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;?&gt;\n&lt;contextConfiguration xmlns=&quot;http://capgemini.com&quot;\nxmlns:xsi=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance&quot;\nversion=&quot;1.0&quot;&gt;\n&lt;triggers&gt;\n...\n&lt;/triggers&gt;\n&lt;/contextConfiguration&gt;\nThe context configuration has a version attribute, which should match the XSD version the context configuration is an instance of. It should not state the version of the currently released version of CobiGen. This attribute should be maintained by the context configuration developers. If configured correctly, it will provide a better feedback for the user and thus higher user experience. Currently there is only the version v1.0. For further version there will be a changelog later on.\nTrigger Node\nAs children of the &lt;triggers&gt; node you can define different triggers. By defining a &lt;trigger&gt; you declare a mapping between special inputs and a templateFolder, which contains all templates, which are worth to be generated with the given input.\nListing 98. trigger configuration\n&lt;trigger id=&quot;...&quot; type=&quot;...&quot; templateFolder=&quot;...&quot; inputCharset=&quot;UTF-8&quot; &gt;\n...\n&lt;/trigger&gt;\nThe attribute id should be unique within an context configuration. It is necessary for efficient internal processing.\nThe attribute type declares a specific trigger interpreter, which might be provided by additional plug-ins. A trigger interpreter has to provide an input reader, which reads specific inputs and creates a template object model out of it to be processed by the FreeMarker template engine later on. Have a look at the plug-in&#x2019;s documentation of your interest and see, which trigger types and thus inputs are currently supported.\nThe attribute templateFolder declares the relative path to the template folder, which will be used if the trigger gets activated.\nThe attribute inputCharset (optional) determines the charset to be used for reading any input file.\nMatcher Node\nA trigger will be activated if its matchers hold the following formula:\n!(NOT || &#x2026;&#x200B; || NOT) &amp;&amp; AND &amp;&amp; &#x2026;&#x200B; &amp;&amp; AND &amp;&amp; (OR || &#x2026;&#x200B; || OR)\nWhereas NOT/AND/OR describes the accumulationType of a matcher (see below) and e.g. NOT means &apos;a matcher with accumulationType NOT matches a given input&apos;. Thus additionally to an input reader, a trigger interpreter has to define at least one set of matchers, which are satisfiable, to be fully functional. A &lt;matcher&gt; node declares a specific characteristics a valid input should have.\nListing 99. Matcher Configuration\n&lt;matcher type=&quot;...&quot; value=&quot;...&quot; accumulationType=&quot;...&quot;&gt;\n...\n&lt;/matcher&gt;\nThe attribute type declares a specific type of matcher, which has to be provided by the surrounding trigger interpreter. Have a look at the plug-in&#x2019;s documentation, which also provides the used trigger type for more information about valid matcher and their functionalities.\nThe attribute value might contain any information necessary for processing the matcher&#x2019;s functionality. Have a look at the relevant plug-in&#x2019;s documentation for more detail.\nThe attribute accumulationType (optional) specifies how the matcher will influence the trigger activation. Valid values are:\nOR (default): if any matcher of accumulation type OR matches, the trigger will be activated as long as there are no further matchers with different accumulation types\nAND: if any matcher with AND accumulation type does not match, the trigger will not be activated\nNOT: if any matcher with NOT accumulation type matches, the trigger will not be activated\nVariableAssignment Node\nFinally, a &lt;matcher&gt; node can have multiple &lt;variableAssignment&gt; nodes as children. Variable assignments allow to parametrize the generation by additional values, which will be added to the object model for template processing. The variables declared using variable assignments, will be made accessible in the templates.xml as well in the object model for template processing via the namespace variables.*.\nListing 100. Complete Configuration Pattern\n&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;?&gt;\n&lt;contextConfiguration xmlns=&quot;http://capgemini.com&quot;\nxmlns:xsi=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance&quot;\nversion=&quot;1.0&quot;&gt;\n&lt;triggers&gt;\n&lt;trigger id=&quot;...&quot; type=&quot;...&quot; templateFolder=&quot;...&quot;&gt;\n&lt;matcher type=&quot;...&quot; value=&quot;...&quot;&gt;\n&lt;variableAssignment type=&quot;...&quot; key=&quot;...&quot; value=&quot;...&quot; /&gt;\n&lt;/matcher&gt;\n&lt;/trigger&gt;\n&lt;/triggers&gt;\n&lt;/contextConfiguration&gt;\nThe attribute type declares the type of variable assignment to be processed by the trigger interpreter providing plug-in. This attribute enables variable assignments with different dynamic value resolutions.\nThe attribute key declares the namespace under which the resolved value will be accessible later on.\nThe attribute value might declare a constant value to be assigned or any hint for value resolution done by the trigger interpreter providing plug-in. For instance, if type is regex, then on value you will assign the matched group number by the regex (1, 2, 3&#x2026;&#x200B;)\nContainerMatcher Node\nThe &lt;containerMatcher&gt; node is an additional matcher for matching containers of multiple input objects.\nSuch a container might be a package, which encloses multiple types or---more generic---a model, which encloses multiple elements. A container matcher can be declared side by side with other matchers:\nListing 101. ContainerMatcher Declaration\n&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;?&gt;\n&lt;contextConfiguration xmlns=&quot;http://capgemini.com&quot;\nxmlns:xsi=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance&quot;\nversion=&quot;1.0&quot;&gt;\n&lt;triggers&gt;\n&lt;trigger id=&quot;...&quot; type=&quot;...&quot; templateFolder=&quot;...&quot; &gt;\n&lt;containerMatcher type=&quot;...&quot; value=&quot;...&quot; retrieveObjectsRecursively=&quot;...&quot; /&gt;\n&lt;matcher type=&quot;...&quot; value=&quot;...&quot;&gt;\n&lt;variableAssignment type=&quot;...&quot; variable=&quot;...&quot; value=&quot;...&quot; /&gt;\n&lt;/matcher&gt;\n&lt;/trigger&gt;\n&lt;/triggers&gt;\n&lt;/contextConfiguration&gt;\nThe attribute type declares a specific type of matcher, which has to be provided by the surrounding trigger interpreter. Have a look at the plug-in&#x2019;s documentation, which also provides the used trigger type for more information about valid matcher and their functionalities.\nThe attribute value might contain any information necessary for processing the matcher&#x2019;s functionality. Have a look at the relevant plug-in&#x2019;s documentation for more detail.\nThe attribute retrieveObjectsRecursively (optional boolean) states, whether the children of the input should be retrieved recursively to find matching inputs for generation.\nThe semantics of a container matchers are the following:\nA &lt;containerMatcher&gt; does not declare any &lt;variableAssignment&gt; nodes\nA &lt;containerMatcher&gt; matches an input if and only if one of its enclosed elements satisfies a set of &lt;matcher&gt; nodes of the same &lt;trigger&gt;\nInputs, which match a &lt;containerMatcher&gt; will cause a generation for each enclosed element\n"},{"id":486,"path":"../..\\..\\..\\..\\..\\xampp\\htdocs\\devonfw.github.io\\website\\pages\\docs/master-cobigen.asciidoc_cobigen.html#cobigen-core_configuration.asciidoc_templates-configuration","type":"docs","title":"Templates Configuration","body":"71.1.2. Templates Configuration\nThe template configuration (templates.xml) specifies, which templates exist and under which circumstances it will be generated. There are two possible configuration styles:\nConfigure the template meta-data for each template file by template nodes\n(since cobigen-core-v1.2.0): Configure templateScan nodes to automatically retrieve a default configuration for all files within a configured folder and possibly modify the automatically configured templates using templateExtension nodes\nTo get an intuition of the idea, the following will initially describe the first (more extensive) configuration style. Such an configuration root structure looks as follows:\nListing 102. Extensive Templates Configuration\n&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;?&gt;\n&lt;templatesConfiguration xmlns=&quot;http://capgemini.com&quot;\nxmlns:xsi=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance&quot;\nversion=&quot;1.0&quot; templateEngine=&quot;FreeMarker&quot;&gt;\n&lt;templates&gt;\n...\n&lt;/templates&gt;\n&lt;increments&gt;\n...\n&lt;/increments&gt;\n&lt;/templatesConfiguration&gt;\nThe root node &lt;templatesConfiguration&gt; specifies two attributes. The attribute version provides further usability support and will be handled analogous to the version attribute of the context configuration. The optional attribute templateEngine specifies the template engine to be used for processing the templates (since cobigen-core-4.0.0). By default it is set to FreeMarker.\nThe node &lt;templatesConfiguration&gt; allows two different grouping nodes as children. First, there is the &lt;templates&gt; node, which groups all declarations of templates. Second, there is the &lt;increments&gt; node, which groups all declarations about increments.\nTemplate Node\nThe &lt;templates&gt; node groups multiple &lt;template&gt; declarations, which enables further generation. Each template file should be registered at least once as a template to be considered.\nListing 103. Example Template Configuration\n&lt;templates&gt;\n&lt;template name=&quot;...&quot; destinationPath=&quot;...&quot; templateFile=&quot;...&quot; mergeStrategy=&quot;...&quot; targetCharset=&quot;...&quot; /&gt;\n...\n&lt;/templates&gt;\nA template declaration consist of multiple information:\nThe attribute name specifies an unique ID within the templates configuration, which will later be reused in the increment definitions.\nThe attribute destinationPath specifies the destination path the template will be generated to. It is possible to use all variables defined by variable assignments within the path declaration using the FreeMarker syntax ${variables.*}. While resolving the variable expressions, each dot within the value will be automatically replaced by a slash. This behavior is accounted for by the transformations of Java packages to paths as CobiGen has first been developed in the context of the Java world. Furthermore, the destination path variable resolution provides the following additional built-in operators analogue to the FreeMarker syntax:\n?cap_first analogue to FreeMarker\n?uncap_first analogue to FreeMarker\n?lower_case analogue to FreeMarker\n?upper_case analogue to FreeMarker\n?replace(regex, replacement) - Replaces all occurrences of the regular expression regex in the variable&#x2019;s value with the given replacement string. (since cobigen-core v1.1.0)\n?removeSuffix(suffix) - Removes the given suffix in the variable&#x2019;s value iff the variable&#x2019;s value ends with the given suffix. Otherwise nothing will happen. (since cobigen-core v1.1.0)\n?removePrefix(prefix) - Analogue to ?removeSuffix but removes the prefix of the variable&#x2019;s value. (since cobigen-core v1.1.0)\nThe attribute templateFile describes the relative path dependent on the template folder specified in the trigger to the template file to be generated.\nThe attribute mergeStrategy (optional) can be optionally specified and declares the type of merge mechanism to be used, when the destinationPath points to an already existing file. CobiGen by itself just comes with a mergeStrategy override, which enforces file regeneration in total. Additional available merge strategies have to be obtained from the different plug-in&#x2019;s documentations (see here for java, XML, properties, and text). Default: not set (means not mergeable)\nThe attribute targetCharset (optional) can be optionally specified and declares the encoding with which the contents will be written into the destination file. This also includes reading an existing file at the destination path for merging its contents with the newly generated ones. Default: UTF-8\n(Since version 4.1.0) It is possible to reference external template (templates defined on another trigger), thanks to using &lt;incrementRef &#x2026;&#x200B;&gt; that are explained here.\nTemplateScan Node\n(since cobigen-core-v1.2.0)\nThe second configuration style for template meta-data is driven by initially scanning all available templates and automatically configure them with a default set of meta-data. A scanning configuration might look like this:\nListing 104. Example of Template-scan configuration\n&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;?&gt;\n&lt;templatesConfiguration xmlns=&quot;http://capgemini.com&quot;\nxmlns:xsi=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance&quot;\nversion=&quot;1.2&quot;&gt;\n&lt;templateScans&gt;\n&lt;templateScan templatePath=&quot;templates&quot; templateNamePrefix=&quot;prefix_&quot; destinationPath=&quot;src/main/java&quot;/&gt;\n&lt;/templateScans&gt;\n&lt;/templatesConfiguration&gt;\nYou can specify multiple &lt;templateScan &#x2026;&#x200B;&gt; nodes for different templatePaths and different templateNamePrefixes.\nThe name can be specified to later on reference the templates found by a template-scan within an increment. (since cobigen-core-v2.1.)\nThe templatePath specifies the relative path from the templates.xml to the root folder from which the template scan should be performed.\nThe templateNamePrefix (optional) defines a common id prefix, which will be added to all found and automatically configured templates.\nThe destinationPath defines the root folder all found templates should be generated to, whereas the root folder will be a prefix for all found and automatically configured templates.\nA templateScan will result in the following default configuration of templates. For each file found, new template will be created virtually with the following default values:\nid: file name without .ftl extension prefixed by templateNamePrefix from template-scan\ndestinationPath: relative file path of the file found with the prefix defined by destinationPath from template-scan. Furthermore,\nit is possible to use the syntax for accessing and modifying variables as described for the attribute destinationPath of the template node, besides the only difference, that due to file system restrictions you have to replace all ?-signs (for built-ins) with #-signs.\nthe files to be scanned, should provide their final file extension by the following file naming convention: &lt;filename&gt;.&lt;extension&gt;.ftl Thus the file extension .ftl will be removed after generation.\ntemplateFile: relative path to the file found\nmergeStrategy: (optional) not set means not mergeable\ntargetCharset: (optional) defaults to UTF-8\n(Since version 4.1.0) It is possible to reference external templateScan (templateScans defined on another trigger), thanks to using &lt;incrementRef &#x2026;&#x200B;&gt; that are explained here.\nTemplateExtension Node\n(since cobigen-core-v1.2.0)\nAdditionally to the templateScan declaration it is easily possible to rewrite specific attributes for any scanned and automatically configured template.\nListing 105. Example Configuration of a TemplateExtension\n&lt;templates&gt;\n&lt;templateExtension ref=&quot;prefix_FooClass.java&quot; mergeStrategy=&quot;javamerge&quot; /&gt;\n&lt;/templates&gt;\n&lt;templateScans&gt;\n&lt;templateScan templatePath=&quot;foo&quot; templateNamePrefix=&quot;prefix_&quot; destinationPath=&quot;src/main/java/foo&quot;/&gt;\n&lt;/templateScans&gt;\nLets assume, that the above example declares a template-scan for the folder foo, which contains a file FooClass.java.ftl in any folder depth. Thus the template scan will automatically create a virtual template declaration with id=prefix_FooClass.java and further default configuration.\nUsing the templateExtension declaration above will reference the scanned template by the attribute ref and overrides the mergeStrategy of the automatically configured template by the value javamerge. Thus we are able to minimize the needed templates configuration.\n(Since version 4.1.0) It is possible to reference external templateExtension (templateExtensions defined on another trigger), thanks to using &lt;incrementRef &#x2026;&#x200B;&gt; that are explained here.\nIncrement Node\nThe &lt;increments&gt; node groups multiple &lt;increment&gt; nodes, which can be seen as a collection of templates to be generated. An increment will be defined by a unique id and a human readable description.\n&lt;increments&gt;\n&lt;increment id=&quot;...&quot; description=&quot;...&quot;&gt;\n&lt;incrementRef ref=&quot;...&quot; /&gt;\n&lt;templateRef ref=&quot;...&quot; /&gt;\n&lt;templateScanRef ref=&quot;...&quot; /&gt;\n&lt;/increment&gt;\n&lt;/increments&gt;\nAn increment might contain multiple increments and/or templates, which will be referenced using &lt;incrementRef &#x2026;&#x200B;&gt;, &lt;templateRef &#x2026;&#x200B;&gt;, resp. &lt;templateScanRef &#x2026;&#x200B;&gt; nodes. These nodes only declare the attribute ref, which will reference an increment, a template, or a template-scan by its id or name.\n(Since version 4.1.0) An special case of &lt;incrementRef &#x2026;&#x200B;&gt; is the external incrementsRef. By default, &lt;incrementRef &#x2026;&#x200B;&gt; are used to reference increments defined in the same templates.xml file. So for example, we could have:\n&lt;increments&gt;\n&lt;increment id=&quot;incA&quot; description=&quot;...&quot;&gt;\n&lt;incrementRef ref=&quot;incB&quot; /&gt;\n&lt;/increment&gt;\n&lt;increment id=&quot;incB&quot; description=&quot;...&quot;&gt;\n&lt;templateRef .... /&gt;\n&lt;templateScan .... /&gt;\n&lt;/increment&gt;\n&lt;/increments&gt;\nHowever, if we want to reference an increment that it is not defined inside our templates.xml (an increment defined for another trigger), then we can use external incrementRef as shown below:\n&lt;increment name=&quot;...&quot; description=&quot;...&quot;&gt;\n&lt;incrementRef ref=&quot;trigger_id::increment_id&quot;/&gt;\n&lt;/increment&gt;\nThe ref string is split using as delimiter ::. The first part of the string, is the trigger_id to reference. That trigger contains an increment_id. Currently, this functionality only works when both templates use the same kind of input file.\n"},{"id":487,"path":"../..\\..\\..\\..\\..\\xampp\\htdocs\\devonfw.github.io\\website\\pages\\docs/master-cobigen.asciidoc_cobigen.html#cobigen-core_configuration.asciidoc_java-template-logic","type":"docs","title":"Java Template Logic","body":"71.1.3. Java Template Logic\nsince cobigen-core-3.0.0 which is included in the Eclipse and Maven Plugin since version 2.0.0\nIn addition, it is possible to implement more complex template logic by custom Java code. To enable this feature, you can simply import the the CobiGen_Templates by clicking on Adapt Templates, turn it into a simple maven project (if it is not already) and implement any Java logic in the common maven layout (e.g. in the source folder src/main/java). Each Java class will be instantiated by CobiGen for each generation process. Thus, you can even store any state within a Java class instance during generation. However, there is currently no guarantee according to the template processing order.\nAs a consequence, you have to implement your Java classes with a public default (non-parameter) constructor to be used by any template. Methods of the implemented Java classes can be called within templates by the simple standard FreeMarker expression for calling Bean methods: SimpleType.methodName(param1). Until now, CobiGen will shadow multiple types with the same simple name non-deterministically. So please prevent yourself from that situation.\nFinally, if you would like to do some reflection within your Java code accessing any type of the template project or any type referenced by the input, you should load classes by making use of the classloader of the util classes. CobiGen will take care of the correct classloader building including the classpath of the input source as well as of the classpath of the template project. If you use any other classloader or build it by your own, there will be no guarantee, that generation succeeds.\n"},{"id":488,"path":"../..\\..\\..\\..\\..\\xampp\\htdocs\\devonfw.github.io\\website\\pages\\docs/master-cobigen.asciidoc_cobigen.html#cobigen-core_configuration.asciidoc_template-properties","type":"docs","title":"Template Properties","body":"71.1.4. Template Properties\nsince cobigen-core-4.0.0\nUsing a configuration with template scan, you can make use of properties in templates specified in property files named cobigen.properties next to the templates. The property files are specified as Java property files. Property files can be nested in subfolders. Properties will be resolved including property shading. Properties defined nearest to the template to be generated will take precedence.\nIn addition, a cobigen.properties file can be specified in the target folder root (in eclipse plugin, this is equal to the source project root). These properties take precedence over template properties specified in the template folder.\nNote\nIt is not allowed to override context variables in cobigen.properties specifications as we have not found any interesting use case. This is most probably an error of the template designer, CobiGen will raise an error in this case.\nMulti module support or template target path redirects\nsince cobigen-core-4.0.0\nOne special property you can specify in the template properties is the property relocate. It will cause the current folder and its subfolders to be relocated at destination path resolution time. Take the following example:\nfolder\n- sub1\nTemplate.java.ftl\ncobigen.properties\nLet the cobigen.properties file contain the line relocate=../sub2/${cwd}. Given that, the relative destination path of Template.java.ftl will be resolved to folder/sub2/Template.java. Compare template scan configuration for more information about basic path resolution. The relocate property specifies a relative path from the location of the cobigen.properties. The ${cwd} placeholder will contain the remaining relative path from the cobigen.properties location to the template file. In this basic example it just contains Template.java.ftl, but it may even be any relative path including subfolders of sub1 and its templates.\nGiven the relocate feature, you can even step out of the root path, which in general is the project/maven module the input is located in. This enables template designers to even address, e.g., maven modules located next to the module the input is coming from.\n"},{"id":489,"path":"../..\\..\\..\\..\\..\\xampp\\htdocs\\devonfw.github.io\\website\\pages\\docs/master-cobigen.asciidoc_cobigen.html#cobigen-core_configuration.asciidoc_basic-template-model","type":"docs","title":"Basic Template Model","body":"71.1.5.

Java Plug-in\nThe CobiGen Java Plug-in comes with a new input reader for java artifacts, new java related trigger and matchers, as well as a merging mechanism for Java sources.\nTrigger extension\nThe Java Plug-in provides a new trigger for Java related inputs. It accepts different representations as inputs (see Java input reader) and provides additional matching and variable assignment mechanisms. The configuration in the context.xml for this trigger looks like this:\ntype &apos;java&apos;\nListing 106. Example of a java trigger definition\n&lt;trigger id=&quot;...&quot; type=&quot;java&quot; templateFolder=&quot;...&quot;&gt;\n...\n&lt;/trigger&gt;\nThis trigger type enables Java elements as inputs.\nMatcher types\nWith the trigger you might define matchers, which restrict the input upon specific aspects:\ntype &apos;fqn&apos; &#x2192; full qualified name matching\nListing 107.

Valid expressions are\ninstanceof fqn: checks an &apos;is a&apos; relation of the input type\nisAbstract: checks, whether the input type is declared abstract\nContainerMatcher types\nAdditionally, the java plugin provides the ability to match packages (containers) as follows:\ntype &apos;package&apos;\nListing 110. Example of a java trigger definition with a container matcher for packages\n&lt;trigger id=&quot;...&quot; type=&quot;java&quot; templateFolder=&quot;...&quot;&gt;\n&lt;containerMatcher type=&quot;package&quot; value=&quot;com\\.example\\.app\\.component1\\.persistence.entity&quot; /&gt;\n&lt;/trigger&gt;\nThe container matcher matches packages provided by the type com.capgemini.cobigen.javaplugin.inputreader.to.PackageFolder with a regular expression stated in the value attribute. (See containerMatcher semantics to get more information about containerMatchers itself.)\nVariableAssignment types\nFurthermore, it provides the ability to extract information from each input for further processing in the templates. The values assigned by variable assignments will be made available in template and the destinationPath of context.xml through the namespace variables.&lt;key&gt;. The Java Plug-in currently provides two different mechanisms:\ntype &apos;regex&apos; &#x2192; regular expression group\n&lt;trigger id=&quot;...&quot; type=&quot;java&quot; templateFolder=&quot;...&quot;&gt;\n&lt;matcher type=&quot;fqn&quot; value=&quot;(.+)\\.persistence\\.([^\\.]+)\\.entity\\.([^\\.]+)&quot;&gt;\n&lt;variableAssignment type=&quot;regex&quot; key=&quot;rootPackage&quot; value=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;\n&lt;variableAssignment type=&quot;regex&quot; key=&quot;component&quot; value=&quot;2&quot; /&gt;\n&lt;variableAssignment type=&quot;regex&quot; key=&quot;pojoName&quot; value=&quot;3&quot; /&gt;\n&lt;/matcher&gt;\n&lt;/trigger&gt;\nThis variable assignment assigns the value of the given regular expression group number to the given key.\ntype &apos;constant&apos; &#x2192; constant parameter\n&lt;trigger id=&quot;...&quot; type=&quot;java&quot; templateFolder=&quot;...&quot;&gt;\n&lt;matcher type=&quot;fqn&quot; value=&quot;(.+)\\.persistence\\.([^\\.]+)\\.entity\\.([^\\.]+)&quot;&gt;\n&lt;variableAssignment type=&quot;constant&quot; key=&quot;domain&quot; value=&quot;restaurant&quot; /&gt;\n&lt;/matcher&gt;\n&lt;/trigger&gt;\nThis variable assignment assigns the value to the key as a constant.\nJava input reader\nThe Cobigen Java Plug-in implements an input reader for parsed java sources as well as for java Class&lt;?&gt; objects (loaded by reflection). So API user can pass Class&lt;?&gt; objects as well as JavaClass objects for generation. The latter depends on QDox, which will be used for parsing and merging java sources. For getting the right parsed java inputs you can easily use the JavaParserUtil, which provides static functionality to parse java files and get the appropriate JavaClass object.\nFurthermore, due to restrictions on both inputs according to model building (see below), it is also possible to provide an array of length two as an input, which contains the Class&lt;?&gt; as well as the JavaClass object of the same class.\nTemplate object model\nNo matter whether you use reflection objects or parsed java classes as input, you will get the following object model for template creation:\nclassObject (&apos;Class&apos; :: Class object of the Java input)\npojo\nname (&apos;String&apos; :: Simple name of the input class)\npackage (&apos;String&apos; :: Package name of the input class)\ncanonicalName (&apos;String&apos; :: Full qualified name of the input class)\nannotations (&apos;Map&lt;String, Object&gt;&apos; :: Annotations, which will be represented by a mapping of the full qualified type of an annotation to its value. To gain template compatibility, the key will be stored with &apos;_&apos; instead of &apos;.&apos; in the full qualified annotation type. Furthermore, the annotation might be recursively defined and thus be accessed using the same type of mapping. Example ${pojo.annotations.javax_persistence_Id})\njavaDoc (&apos;Map&lt;String, Object&gt;&apos;) :: A generic way of addressing all available javaDoc doclets and comments. The only fixed variable is comment (see below). All other provided variables depend on the doclets found while parsing. The value of a doclet can be accessed by the doclets name (e.g. ${&#x2026;&#x200B;javaDoc.author}). In case of doclet tags that can be declared multiple times (currently @param and @throws), you will get a map, which you access in a specific way (see below).\ncomment (&apos;String&apos; :: javaDoc comment, which does not include any doclets)\nparams (&apos;Map&lt;String,String&gt; :: javaDoc parameter info. If the comment follows proper conventions, the key will be the name of the parameter and the value being its description. You can also access the parameters by their number, as in arg0, arg1 etc, following the order of declaration in the signature, not in order of javadoc)\nthrows (&apos;Map&lt;String,String&gt; :: javaDoc exception info. If the comment follows proper conventions, the key will be the name of the thrown exception and the value being its description)\nextendedType (&apos;Map&lt;String, Object&gt;&apos; :: The supertype, represented by a set of mappings (since cobigen-javaplugin v1.1.0)\nname (&apos;String&apos; :: Simple name of the supertype)\ncanonicalName (&apos;String&apos; :: Full qualified name of the supertype)\npackage (&apos;String&apos; :: Package name of the supertype)\nimplementedTypes (&apos;List&lt;Map&lt;String, Object&gt;&gt;&apos; :: A list of all implementedTypes (interfaces) represented by a set of mappings (since cobigen-javaplugin v1.1.0)\ninterface (&apos;Map&lt;String, Object&gt;&apos; :: List element)\nname (&apos;String&apos; :: Simple name of the interface)\ncanonicalName (&apos;String&apos; :: Full qualified name of the interface)\npackage (&apos;String&apos; :: Package name of the interface)\nfields (&apos;List&lt;Map&lt;String, Object&gt;&gt;&apos; :: List of fields of the input class) (renamed since cobigen-javaplugin v1.2.0; previously attributes)\nfield (&apos;Map&lt;String, Object&gt;&apos; :: List element)\nname (&apos;String&apos; :: Name of the Java field)\ntype (&apos;String&apos; :: Type of the Java field)\ncanonicalType (&apos;String&apos; :: Full qualified type declaration of the Java field&#x2019;s type)\n&apos;isId&apos; (&apos;Deprecated&apos; :: &apos;boolean&apos; :: true if the Java field or its setter or its getter is annotated with the javax.persistence.Id annotation, false otherwise. Equivalent to ${pojo.attributes[i].annotations.javax_persistence_Id?has_content})\njavaDoc (see pojo.javaDoc)\nannotations (see pojo.annotations with the remark, that for fields all annotations of its setter and getter will also be collected)\nmethodAccessibleFields (&apos;List&lt;Map&lt;String, Object&gt;&gt;&apos; :: List of fields of the input class or its inherited classes, which are accessible using setter and getter methods)\nsame as for field (but without javaDoc!)\nmethods (&apos;List&lt;Map&lt;String, Object&gt;&gt;&apos; :: The list of all methods, whereas one method will be represented by a set of property mappings)\nmethod (&apos;Map&lt;String, Object&gt;&apos; :: List element)\nname (&apos;String&apos; :: Name of the method)\njavaDoc (see pojo.javaDoc)\nannotations (see pojo.annotations)\nFurthermore, when providing a Class&lt;?&gt; object as input, the Java Plug-in will provide additional functionalities as template methods (deprecated):\nisAbstract(String fqn) (Checks whether the type with the given full qualified name is an abstract class. Returns a boolean value.) (since cobigen-javaplugin v1.1.1) (deprecated)\nisSubtypeOf(String subType, String superType) (Checks whether the subType declared by its full qualified name is a sub type of the superType declared by its full qualified name. Equals the Java expression subType instanceof superType and so also returns a boolean value.) (since cobigen-javaplugin v1.1.1) (deprecated)\nModel Restrictions\nAs stated before both inputs (Class&lt;?&gt; objects and JavaClass objects ) have their restrictions according to model building. In the following these restrictions are listed for both models, the ParsedJava Model which results from an JavaClass input and the ReflectedJava Model, which results from a Class&lt;?&gt;` input.\nIt is important to understand, that these restrictions are only present if you work with either Parsed Model OR the Reflected Model. If you use the Maven Build Plug-in or Eclipse Plug-in these two models are merged together so that they can mutually compensate their weaknesses.\nParsed Model\nannotations of the input&#x2019;s supertype are not accessible due to restrictions in the QDox library. So pojo.methodAccessibleFields[i].annotations will always be empty for super type fields.\nannotations&apos; parameter values are available as Strings only (e.g. the Boolean value true is transformed into &quot;true&quot;).

It accepts xml documents as input (see XML input reader) and provides additional matching and variable assignment mechanisms. The configuration in the context.xml for this trigger looks like this:\ntype &apos;xml&apos;\nListing 111. Example of a xml trigger definition.\n&lt;trigger id=&quot;...&quot; type=&quot;xml&quot; templateFolder=&quot;...&quot;&gt;\n...\n&lt;/trigger&gt;\nThis trigger type enables xml documents as inputs.\ntype &apos;xpath&apos;\nListing 112. Example of a xpath trigger definition.\n&lt;trigger id=&quot;...&quot; type=&quot;xpath&quot; templateFolder=&quot;...&quot;&gt;\n...\n&lt;/trigger&gt;\nThis trigger type enables xml documents as container inputs, which consists of several subdocuments.\nContainerMatcher type\nA ContainerMatcher check if the input is a valid container.\nxpath: type: &apos;xpath&apos;\nListing 113. Example of a xml trigger definition with a nodename matcher.\n&lt;trigger id=&quot;...&quot; type=&quot;xml&quot; templateFolder=&quot;...&quot;&gt;\n&lt;containerMatcher type=&quot;xpath&quot; value=&quot;./uml:Model//packagedElement[@xmi:type=&apos;uml:Class&apos;]&quot;&gt;\n...\n&lt;/matcher&gt;\n&lt;/trigger&gt;\nBefore applying any Matcher, this containerMatcher checks if the XML file contains a node &quot;uml:Model&quot; with a childnode &quot;packagedElement&quot; which contains an attribute &quot;xmi:type&quot; with the value &quot;uml:Class&quot;.\nMatcher types\nWith the trigger you might define matchers, which restrict the input upon specific aspects:\nxml: type &apos;nodename&apos; &#x2192; document&#x2019;s root name matching\nListing 114. Example of a xml trigger definition with a nodename matcher\n&lt;trigger id=&quot;...&quot; type=&quot;xml&quot; templateFolder=&quot;...&quot;&gt;\n&lt;matcher type=&quot;nodename&quot; value=&quot;\\D\\w*&quot;&gt;\n...\n&lt;/matcher&gt;\n&lt;/trigger&gt;\nThis trigger will be enabled if the root name of the declaring input document matches the given regular expression (value).\nxpath: type: &apos;xpath&apos; &#x2192; matching a node with a xpath value\nListing 115. Example of a xpath trigger definition with a xpath matcher.\n&lt;trigger id=&quot;...&quot; type=&quot;xml&quot; templateFolder=&quot;...&quot;&gt;\n&lt;matcher type=&quot;xpath&quot; value=&quot;/packagedElement[@xmi:type=&apos;uml:Class&apos;]&quot;&gt;\n...\n&lt;/matcher&gt;\n&lt;/trigger&gt;\nThis trigger will be enabled if the XML file contains a node &quot;/packagedElement&quot; where the &quot;xmi:type&quot; property equals &quot;uml:Class&quot;.\nVariableAssignment types\nFurthermore, it provides the ability to extract information from each input for further processing in the templates. The values assigned by variable assignments will be made available in template and the destinationPath of context.xml through the namespace variables.&lt;key&gt;. The XML Plug-in currently provides only one mechanism:\ntype &apos;constant&apos; &#x2192; constant parameter\n&lt;trigger id=&quot;...&quot; type=&quot;xml&quot; templateFolder=&quot;...&quot;&gt;\n&lt;matcher type=&quot;nodename&quot; value=&quot;\\D\\w*&quot;&gt;\n&lt;variableAssignment type=&quot;constant&quot; key=&quot;domain&quot; value=&quot;restaurant&quot; /&gt;\n&lt;/matcher&gt;\n&lt;/trigger&gt;\nThis variable assignment assigns the value to the key as a constant.\nXML input reader\nThe Cobigen XML Plug-in implements an input reader for parsed xml documents. So API user can pass org.w3c.dom.Document objects for generation. For getting the right parsed xml inputs you can easily use the xmlplugin.util.XmlUtil, which provides static functionality to parse xml files or input streams and get the appropriate Document object.\nTemplate object\nDue to the heterogeneous structure an xml document can have, the xml input reader does not always create exactly the same model structure (in contrast to the java input reader). For example the model&#x2019;s depth differs strongly, according to it&#x2019;s input document. To allow navigational access to the nodes, the model also depends on the document&#x2019;s element&#x2019;s node names. All child elements with unique names, are directly accessible via their names. In addition it is possible to iterate over all child elements with held of the child list Children. So it is also possible to access child elements with non unique names.\nThe XML input reader will create the following object model for template creation (EXAMPLEROOT, EXAMPLENODE1, EXAMPLENODE2, EXAMPLEATTR1,&#x2026;&#x200B; are just used here as examples. Of course they will be replaced later by the actual node or attribute names):\n~EXAMPLEROOT~ (&apos;Map&lt;String, Object&gt;&apos; :: common element structure)\n_nodeName_ (&apos;String&apos; :: Simple name of the root node)\n_text_ (&apos;String&apos; :: Concatenated text content (PCDATA) of the root node)\nTextNodes (&apos;List&lt;String&gt;&apos; :: List of all the root&#x2019;s text node contents)\n_at_~EXAMPLEATTR1~ (&apos;String&apos; :: String representation of the attribute&#x2019;s value)\n_at_~EXAMPLEATTR2~ (&apos;String&apos; :: String representation of the attribute&#x2019;s value)\n_at_&#x2026;&#x200B;\nAttributes (&apos;List&lt;Map&lt;String, Object&gt;&gt;&apos; :: List of the root&#x2019;s attributes\nat (&apos;Map&lt;String, Object&gt;&apos; :: List element)\n_attName_ (&apos;String&apos; :: Name of the attribute)\n_attValue_ (&apos;String&apos; :: String representation of the attribute&#x2019;s value)\nChildren (&apos;List&lt;Map&lt;String, Object&gt;&gt;&apos; :: List of the root&#x2019;s child elements\nchild (&apos;Map&lt;String, Object&gt;&apos; :: List element)\n&#x2026;&#x200B;common element sub structure&#x2026;&#x200B;\n~EXAMPLENODE1~ (&apos;Map&lt;String, Object&gt;&apos; :: One of the root&#x2019;s child nodes)\n&#x2026;&#x200B;common element structure&#x2026;&#x200B;\n~EXAMPLENODE2~ (&apos;Map&lt;String, Object&gt;&apos; :: One of the root&#x2019;s child nodes)\n&#x2026;&#x200B;common element sub structure&#x2026;&#x200B;\n~EXAMPLENODE21~ (&apos;Map&lt;String, Object&gt;&apos; :: One of the nodes&apos; child nodes)\n&#x2026;&#x200B;common element structure&#x2026;&#x200B;\n~EXAMPLENODE&#x2026;&#x200B;~\n~EXAMPLENODE&#x2026;&#x200B;~\nIn contrast to the java input reader, this xml input reader does currently not provide any additional template methods.\nMerger extensions\nThe XML plugin uses the LeXeMe merger library to produce semantically correct merge products. The merge strategies can be found in the MergeType enum and can be configured in the templates.xml as a mergeStrategy attribute:\nmergeStrategy &apos;xmlmerge&apos;\nListing 116. Example of a template using the mergeStrategy xmlmerge\n&lt;templates&gt;\n&lt;template name=&quot;...&quot; destinationPath=&quot;...&quot; templateFile=&quot;...&quot; mergeStrategy=&quot;xmlmerge&quot;/&gt;\n&lt;/templates&gt;\nCurrently only the document types included in LeXeMe are supported.\nOn how the merger works consult the LeXeMe Wiki.\n"},{"id":495,"path":"../..\\..\\..\\..\\..\\xampp\\htdocs\\devonfw.github.io\\website\\pages\\docs/master-cobigen.asciidoc_cobigen.html#cobigen-textmerger.asciidoc","type":"docs","title":"Text Merger Plug-in","body":"71.2.4. Text Merger Plug-in\nThe Text Merger Plug-in enables merging result free text documents to existing free text documents. Therefore, the algorithms are also very rudimentary.\nMerger extensions\nThere are currently three main merge strategies that apply for the whole document:\nmerge strategy textmerge_append (appends the text directly to the end of the existing document)\n_Remark_: If no anchors are defined, this will simply append the patch.\nmerge strategy textmerge_appendWithNewLine (appends the text after adding a new line break to the existing document)\n_Remark_: empty patches will not result in appending a new line any more since v1.0.1\nRemark: Only suitable if no anchors are defined, otherwise it will simply act as textmerge_append\nmerge strategy textmerge_override (replaces the contents of the existing file with the patch)\n_Remark_: If anchors are defined, override is set as the default mergestrategy for every text block if not redefined in an anchor specification.\nAnchor functionality\nIf a template contains text that fits the definition of anchor:${documentpart}:${mergestrategy}:anchorend or more specifically the regular expression (.*)anchor:([:]+):(newline_)?([:]+)(_newline)?:anchorend\\\\s*(\\\\r\\\\n|\\\\r|\\\\n), some additional functionality becomes available about specific parts of the incoming text and the way it will be merged with the existing text. These anchors always change things about the text to come up until the next anchor, text before it is ignored.\nIf no anchors are defined, the complete patch will be appended depending on your choice for the template in the file templates.xml.\nAnchor Definition\nAnchors should always be defined as a comment of the language the template results in, as you do not want them to appear in your readable version, but cannot define them as freemarker comments in the template, or the merger will not know about them.\nAnchors will also be read when they are not comments due to the merger being able to merge multiple types of text-based languages, thus making it practically impossible to filter for the correct comment declaration. That is why anchors have to always be followed by line breaks. That way there is a universal way to filter anchors that should have anchor functionality and ones that should appear in the text.\nRemark: If the resulting language has closing tags for comments, they have to appear in the next line.\nRemark: If you do not put the anchor into a new line, all the text that appears before it will be added to the anchor.\nDocumentparts\nIn general, ${documentpart} is an id to mark a part of the document, that way the merger knows what parts of the text to merge with which parts of the patch (e.g. if the existing text contains anchor:table:${}:anchorend that part will be merged with the part tagged anchor:table:${}:anchorend of the patch).\nIf the same documentpart is defined multiple times, it can lead to errors, so instead of defining table multiple times, use table1, table2, table3 etc.\nIf a ${documentpart} is defined in the document but not in the patch and they are in the same position, it is processed in the following way: If only the documentparts header, test and footer are defined in the document in that order, and the patch contains header, order and footer, the resulting order will be header, test, order then footer.\nThe following documentparts have default functionality:\nanchor:header:${mergestrategy}:anchorend marks the beginning of a header, that will be added once when the document is created, but not again.\nRemark: This is only done once, if you have header in another anchor, it will be ignored\nanchor:footer:${mergestrategy}:anchorend marks the beginning of a footer, that will be added once when the document is created, but not again. Once this is invoked, all following text will be included in the footer, including other anchors.\nMergestrategies\nMergestrategies are only relevant in the patch, as the merger is only interested in how text in the patch should be managed, not how it was managed in the past.\nanchor:${documentpart}::anchorend will use the merge strategy from templates.xml, see Merger-Extensions.\nanchor:${}:${mergestrategy}_newline:anchorend or anchor:${}:newline_${mergestrategy}:anchorend states that a new line should be appended before or after this anchors text, depending on where the newline is (before or after the mergestrategy). anchor:${documentpart}:newline:anchorend puts a new line after the anchors text.\nRemark: Only works with appending strategies, not merging/replacing ones. These strategies currently include: appendbefore, append/appendafter\nanchor:${documentpart}:override:anchorend means that the new text of this documentpart will replace the existing one completely\nanchor:${documentpart}:appendbefore:anchorend or anchor:${documentpart}:appendafter:anchorend/anchor:${documentpart}:append:anchorend specifies whether the text of the patch should come before the existing text or after.\nUsage Examples\nGeneral\nBelow you can see how a file with anchors might look like (using Asciidoc comment tags), with examples of what you might want to use the different functions for.\n// anchor:header:append:anchorend\nTable of contents\nIntroduction/Header\n// anchor:part1:appendafter:anchorend\nLists\nTable entries\n// anchor:part2:nomerge:anchorend\nDocument Separators\nAsciidoc table definitions\n// anchor:part3:override:anchorend\nAnything that you only want once but changes from time to time\n// anchor:footer:append:anchorend\nCopyright Info\nImprint\nMerging\nIn this section you will see a comparison on what files look like before and after merging\noverride\nListing 117.

The OpenApi Plug-in currently provides two different mechanisms:\ntype &apos;constant&apos; &#x2192; constant parameter\n&lt;trigger id=&quot;...&quot; type=&quot;openapi&quot; templateFolder=&quot;...&quot;&gt;\n&lt;containerMatcher type=&quot;element&quot; value=&quot;OpenApiFile&quot;/&gt;\n&lt;matcher type=&quot;element&quot; value=&quot;EntityDef&quot;&gt;\n&lt;variableAssignment type=&quot;constant&quot; key=&quot;rootPackage&quot; value=&quot;com.capgemini.demo&quot; /&gt;\n&lt;/matcher&gt;\n&lt;/trigger&gt;\nThis variable assignment assigns the value of the given regular expression group number to the given key.\nIn this case, the constant type variableAssignment is used to specify the root package where the generate will place the files generated.\ntype &apos;extension&apos; &#x2192; Extraction of the info extensions and the extensions of each entity. (the tags that start with &quot;x-&#x2026;&#x200B;&quot;).\n&lt;trigger id=&quot;...&quot; type=&quot;openapi&quot; templateFolder=&quot;...&quot;&gt;\n&lt;containerMatcher type=&quot;element&quot; value=&quot;OpenAPIFile&quot;/&gt;\n&lt;matcher type=&quot;element&quot; value=&quot;EntityDef&quot;&gt;\n&lt;variableAssignment type=&quot;extension&quot; key=&quot;testingAttribute&quot; value=&quot;x-test&quot;/&gt;\n&lt;variableAssignment type=&quot;extension&quot; key=&quot;rootPackage&quot; value=&quot;x-rootpackage&quot;/&gt;\n&lt;variableAssignment type=&quot;extension&quot; key=&quot;globalVariable&quot; value=&quot;x-global&quot;/&gt;\n&lt;/matcher&gt;\n&lt;/trigger&gt;\nThe &apos;extension&apos; variable assignment tries to find &apos;extensions&apos; (tags that start with &quot;x-&#x2026;&#x200B;&quot;) on the &apos;info&apos;\npart of your file and on the extensions of each entity. value is the extension that our plug-in will try to find on your OpenAPI file. The result will\nbe stored in the variable key.\nAs you will see on the figure below, there are two types of variables: The global ones, that are defined\non the &apos;info&apos; part of the file, and the local ones, that are defined inside each entity.\nTherefore, if you want to define the root package, then you will have to declare it on the &apos;info&apos; part.\nThat way, all your entities will be generated under the same root package (e.g. com.devonfw.project).\nIf no extension with that name was found, then an empty string will be assigned. In the case of not defining the root package, then the code will be generated into src/main/java.\ntype &apos;property&apos; &#x2192; property of the Java Object\n&lt;trigger id=&quot;...&quot; type=&quot;openapi&quot; templateFolder=&quot;...&quot;&gt;\n&lt;containerMatcher type=&quot;element&quot; value=&quot;OpenApiFile&quot;/&gt;\n&lt;matcher type=&quot;element&quot; value=&quot;EntityDef&quot;&gt;\n&lt;variableAssignment type=&quot;property&quot; key=&quot;entityName&quot; value=&quot;name&quot; /&gt;\n&lt;/matcher&gt;\n&lt;/trigger&gt;\nThe &apos;property&apos; variable assignment tries to find the property value of the entities defined on the schema.\nThe value is assigned to the key. The current properties that you will able to get are:\nComponentDef component: It is an object that stores the configuration of an devon4j component. Its only\nproperty is List&lt;PathDef&gt; paths which contains the paths as the ones shown here.\nString componentName: Stores the name of the x-component tag for this entity.\nString name: Name of this entity (as shown on the example above).\nString description: Description of this entity.\nList&lt;PropertyDef&gt; properties: List containing all the properties of this entity. PropertyDef is an object that has the next properties:\nString name.\nString type.\nString format.\nString description.\nBoolean isCollection.\nBoolean isEntity.\nBoolean required.\nMap&lt;String, Object&gt; constraints\nIf no property with that name was found, then it will be set to null.\nFull trigger configuration\n&lt;trigger id=&quot;...&quot; type=&quot;openapi&quot; templateFolder=&quot;...&quot;&gt;\n&lt;containerMatcher type=&quot;element&quot; value=&quot;OpenApiFile&quot;&gt;\n&lt;matcher type=&quot;element&quot; value=&quot;EntityDef&quot;&gt;\n&lt;variableAssignment type=&quot;constant&quot; key=&quot;rootPackage&quot; value=&quot;com.capgemini.demo&quot; /&gt;\n&lt;variableAssignment type=&quot;property&quot; key=&quot;component&quot; value=&quot;componentName&quot; /&gt;\n&lt;variableAssignment type=&quot;property&quot; key=&quot;entityName&quot; value=&quot;name&quot; /&gt;\n&lt;/matcher&gt;\n&lt;/trigger&gt;\nInput reader\nThe Cobigen OpenApi Plug-in implements an input reader for OpenApi 3.0 files. The XML input reader will create the following object model for template creation:\nmodel (&apos;Map&lt;String, Object&gt;&apos; :: common element structure)\nheader (&apos;HeaderDef&apos; :: Definition of the header found at the top of the file)\nname (&apos;String&apos;

Nevertheless, the files generated from an OpenApi file will be Java, XML, JSON, TS, etc&#x2026;&#x200B; so,\nfor each file to be generated defined at templates.xml, must set the mergeStrategy for the specific language (javamerge, javamerge_override, jsonmerge, etc&#x2026;&#x200B;)\n&lt;templates&gt;\n...\n&lt;templateExtension ref=&quot;${variables.entityName}.java&quot; mergeStrategy=&quot;javamerge&quot;/&gt;\n...\n&lt;templateExtension ref=&quot;${variables.entityName}dataGrid.component.ts&quot; mergeStrategy=&quot;tsmerge&quot;/&gt;\n...\n&lt;templateExtension ref=&quot;en.json&quot; mergeStrategy=&quot;jsonmerge&quot;/&gt;\n&lt;/templates&gt;\nUsage\nWriting OpenApi 3.0 contract file\nThe Swagger file must follow the OpenApi 3.0 standard to be readable by CobiGen, otherwise and error will be thrown.\nA full documentation about how to follow this standard can be found Swagger3 Docs.\nThe Swagger file must be at the core folder of your devon4j project, like shown below:\nTo be compatible with CobiGen and devon4j, it must follow some specific configurations. This configurations allows us to avoid redundant definitions as SearchCriteria and PaginatedList objects are used at the services definitions.\nPaths\nJust adding the tags property at the end of the service definitions with the items SearchCriteria and/or paginated put into CobiGen knowledge that an standard devon4j SearchCriteria and/or PaginateListTo object must be generated. That way, the Swagger file will be easier to write and even more understandable.\nThe path must start with the component name, and define an x-component tag with the component name. That way this service will be included into the component services list.\n/componentnamemanagement/v1/entityname/customOperation/:\nx-component: componentnamemanagement\npost:\nsummary: &apos;Summary of the operation&apos;\ndescription: Description of the operation.\noperationId: customOperation\nresponses:\n&apos;200&apos;:\ndescription: Description of the response.\ncontent:\napplication/json:\nschema:\ntype: array\nitems:\n$ref: &apos;#/components/schemas/EntityName&apos;\nrequestBody:\n$ref: &apos;#/components/requestBodies/EntityName&apos;\ntags:\n- searchCriteria\n- paginated\nThat way, CobiGen will be able to generate the endpoint (REST service) customOperation on componentmanagement. If you do not specify the component to generate to (the x-component tag) then this service will not be taken into account for generation.\nService based generation\nIn previous CobiGen versions, we were able to generate code from a contract-first OpenApi specification only when we defined components like the following:\ncomponents:\nschemas:\nShop:\nx-component: shopmanagement\ndescription: Entity definition of Shop\ntype: object\nproperties:\nshopExample:\ntype: string\nmaxLength: 100\nminLength: 5\nuniqueItems: true\nWe could not generate services without the definition of those components.\nIn our current version, we have overcome it, so that now we are able to generate all the services independently. You just need to add an x-component tag with the name of the component that will make use of that service. See here.\nAn small OpenAPI example defining only services can be found below:\nopenapi: 3.0.0\nservers:\n- url: &apos;https://localhost:8081/server/services/rest&apos;\ndescription: Just some data\ninfo:\ntitle: Devon Example\ndescription: Example of a API definition\nversion: 1.0.0\nx-rootpackage: com.capgemini.spoc.openapi\npaths:\n/salemanagement/v1/sale/{saleId}:\nx-component: salemanagement\nget:\noperationId: findSale\nparameters:\n- name: saleId\nin: path\nrequired: true\ndescription: The id of the pet to retrieve\nschema:\ntype: string\nresponses:\n&apos;200&apos;:\ndescription: Any\n/salemanagement/v1/sale/{bla}:\nx-component: salemanagement\nget:\noperationId: findSaleBla\nparameters:\n- name: bla\nin: path\nrequired: true\nschema:\ntype: integer\nformat: int64\nminimum: 10\nmaximum: 200\nresponses:\n&apos;200&apos;:\ndescription: Any\nThen, the increment that you need to select for generating those services is Crud devon4ng Service based Angular:\nFull example\nThis example yaml file can be download from here.\nWarning\nAs you will see on the file, &quot;x-component&quot; tags are obligatory if you want to generate components (entities).

You save the effort for creating, DAOs, Transfer Objects, simple CRUD use cases with REST services and even the client application can be generated.\nCRUD server application for devon4j\nFor the server, the required files for all architectural layers (Data access, logic, and service layer) can be created based on your Entity class. After the generation, you have CRUD functionality for the entity from bottom to top which can be accessed via a RESTful web service. Details are provided in the Devon wiki.\nCRUD client application for devon4ng\nBased on the REST services on the server, you can also generate an Angular client based on devon4ng. With the help of Node.js, you have a working client application for displaying your entities within minutes!\nTestdata Builder for devon4j\nGenerating a builder pattern for POJOs to easily create test data in your tests. CobiGen is not only able to generate a plain builder pattern but rather builder, which follow a specific concept to minimize test data generation efforts in your unit tests. The following Person class as an example:\nListing 94. Person class\npublic class Person {\nprivate String firstname;\nprivate String lastname;\nprivate int birthyear;\n@NotNull\nprivate Address address;\n@NotNull\npublic String getFirstname() {\nreturn this.firstname;\n}\n// additional default setter and getter\n}\nIt is a simple POJO with a validation annotation, to indicate, that firstname should never be null. Creating this object in a test would imply to call every setter, which is kind of nasty. Therefore, the Builder Pattern has been introduced for quite a long time in software engineering, allowing to easily create POJOs with a fluent API. See below.\nListing 95. Builder pattern example\nPerson person = new PersonBuilder()\n.firstname(&quot;Heinz&quot;)\n.lastname(&quot;Erhardt&quot;)\n.birthyear(1909)\n.address(\nnew AddressBuilder().postcode(&quot;22222&quot;)\n.city(&quot;Hamburg&quot;).street(&quot;Luebecker Str. 123&quot;)\n.createNew())\n.addChild(\nnew PersonBuilder()[...].createNew()).createNew();\nThe Builder API generated by CobiGen allows you to set any setter accessible field of a POJO in a fluent way. But in addition lets assume a test, which should check the birth year as precondition for any business operation. So specifying all other fields of Person, especially firstname as it is mandatory to enter business code, would not make sense. The test behavior should just depend on the specification of the birth year and on no other data. So we would like to just provide this data to the test.\nThe Builder classes generated by CobiGen try to tackle this inconvenience by providing the ability to declare default values for any mandatory field due to validation or database constraints.\nListing 96. Builder Outline\npublic class PersonBuilder {\nprivate void fillMandatoryFields() {\nfirstname(&quot;lasdjfa&#xF6;skdlfja&quot;);\naddress(new AddressBuilder().createNew());\n};\nprivate void fillMandatoryFields_custom() {...};\npublic PersonBuilder firstname(String value);\npublic PersonBuilder lastname(String value);\n...\npublic Person createNew();\npublic Person persist(EntityManager em);\npublic List&lt;Person&gt; persistAndDuplicate(EntityManager em, int count);\n}\nLooking at the plotted builder API generated by CobiGen, you will find two private methods. The method fillMandatoryFields will be generated by CobiGen and regenerated every time CobiGen generation will be triggered for the Person class. This method will set every automatically detected field with not null constraints to a default value. However, by implementing fillMandatoryFields_custom on your own, you can reset these values or even specify more default values for any other field of the object. Thus, running new PersonBuilder().birthyear(1909).createNew(); will create a valid object of Person, which is already pre-filled such that it does not influence the test execution besides the fact that it circumvents database and validation issues.\nThis even holds for complex data structures as indicated by address(new AddressBuilder().createNew());. Due to the use of the AddressBuilder for setting the default value for the field address, also the default values for Address will be set automatically.\nFinally, the builder API provides different methods to create new objects.\ncreateNew() just creates a new object from the builder specification and returns it.\npersist(EntityManager) will create a new object from the builder specification and persists it to the database.\npersistAndDuplicate(EntityManager, int) will create the given amount of objects form the builder specification and persists all of these. After the initial generation of each builder, you might want to adapt the method body as you will most probably not be able to persist more than one object with the same field assignments to the database due to unique constraints. Thus, please see the generated comment in the method to adapt unqiue fields accordingly before persisting to the database.\nCustom Builder for Business Needs\nCobiGen just generates basic builder for any POJO. However, for project needs you probably would like to have even more complex builders, which enable the easy generation of more complex test data which are encoded in a large object hierarchy. Therefore, the generated builders can just be seen as a tool to achieve this. You can define your own business driven builders in the same way as the generated builders, but explicitly focusing on your business needs. Just take this example as a demonstration of that idea:\nUniversity uni = new ComplexUniversityBuilder()\n.withStudents(200)\n.withProfessors(4)\n.withExternalStudent()\n.createNew();\nE.g. the method withExternalStudent() might create a person, which is a student and is flagged to be an external student. Basing this implementation on the generated builders will even assure that you would benefit from any default values you have set before. In addition, you can even imagine any more complex builder methods setting values driven your reusable testing needs based on the specific business knowledge.\n"},{"id":509,"path":"../..\\..\\..\\..\\..\\xampp\\htdocs\\devonfw.github.io\\website\\pages\\docs/master-cobigen.asciidoc_document-description.html#cobigen-usecases.asciidoc_register-factory","type":"docs","title":"Register Factory","body":"70.3.2.

The second one is the batch mode, which will be started if the input contains multiple input artifacts, e.g. for Java this means a list of files.

Increments are a container like concept encompassing multiple files to be generated, which should result in a semantically closed generation output.\nOn the right side of the wizard all files are shown, which might be effected by the generation - dependent on the increment selection of files on the left side. The type of modification of each file will be encoded into following color scheme if the files are selected for generation:\ngreen: files, which are currently non-existent in the file system. These files will be created during generation\nyellow: files, which are currently existent in the file system and which are configured to be merged with generated contents.\nred: files, which are currently existent in the file system. These files will be overwritten if manually selected.\nno color: files, which are currently existent in the file system. Additionally files, which were unselected and thus will be ignored during generation.\nSelecting an increment on the left side will initialize the selection of all shown files to be generated on the right side, whereas green and yellow categorized files will be selected initially. A manual modification of the pre-selection can be performed by switching to the customization tree using the Customize button on the right lower corner.\nOptional: If you want to customize the generation object model of a Java input class, you might continue with the Next &gt; button instead of finishing the generation wizard. The next generation wizard page is currently available for Java file inputs and lists all non-static fields of the input. Unselecting entries will lead to an adapted object model for generation, such that unselected fields will be removed in the object model for generation. By default all fields will be included in the object model.\nUsing the Finish button, the generation will be performed. Finally, CobiGen runs the eclipse internal organize imports and format source code for all generated sources and modified sources.

If this check fails you will see the following message:\nThis indicates, that there is no Project named CobiGen_Templates available in the current workspace. To run CobiGen appropriately, it is necessary to have a configuration project named CobiGen_Templates imported into your workspace. For more information see chapter Eclipse Installation.\nThe second step is to check whether the template project includes a valid context.xml. If this check fails, you will see the following message:\nThis means that either your context.xml\ndoes not exist (or has another name)\nor it is not valid one in any released version of CobiGen\nor there is simply no automatic routine of upgrading your context configuration to a valid state.\nIf all this is not the case, such as, there is a context.xml, which can be successfully read by CobiGen, you might get the following information:\nThis means that your context.xml is available with the correct name but it is outdated (belongs to an older CobiGen version). In this case just click on Upgrade Context Configuration to get the latest version.\nRemark: This will create a backup of your current context configuration and converts your old configuration to the new format. The upgrade will remove all comments from the file, which could be retrieved later on again from the backup.\nIf the creation of the backup fails, you will be asked to continue or to abort.\nThe third step checks whether there are templates for the selected element(s). If this check fails, you will see the following message:\nThis indicates, that there no trigger has been activated, which matches the current selection. The reason might be that your selection is faulty or that you imported the wrong template project (e.g. you are working on a devon4j project, but imported the Templates for the Register Factory). If you are a template developer, have a look at the trigger configuration and at the corresponding available plug-in implementations of triggers, like e.g., Java Plug-in or XML Plug-in.\nIf all the checks are passed you see the following message:\nIn this case everything is OK and the Generate button is not grayed out anymore so that you are able to trigger it and see the simple-mode.\nIn addition to the basic check of the context configuration, you also have the opportunity to perform an Advanced Health Check, which will check all available templates configurations (templates.xml) of path-depth=1 from the configuration project root according to their compatibility.\nAnalogous to the upgrade of the context configuration, the Advanced Health Check will also provide upgrade functionality for templates configurations if available.\n"},{"id":519,"path":"../..\\..\\..\\..\\..\\xampp\\htdocs\\devonfw.github.io\\website\\pages\\docs/master-cobigen.asciidoc_eclipse-integration.html#cobigen-eclipse_usage.asciidoc_update-templates","type":"docs","title":"Update Templates","body":"74.2.4.

Generation\nWe are going to generate the CRUD into a sample application that we have developed for\ntesting this functionality. It is present on your workspaces/examples folder (devon4ng-ionic-application-template). If you do not see it, you can clone or download it from here.\nAfter having that sample app, please create an devon4j project and then start implementing the ETO: You will find an example here.\nAs you can see, TableEto contains 3 attributes: 2 of them are Long and the third one TableState is an enum that you will find\nhere.\nThe Ionic generation works fine for any Java primitive attribute (Strings, floats, chars, boolean&#x2026;&#x200B;) and enums. However, if you want to use your own objects, you should\noverride the toString() method, as explained here.\nThe attributes explained above will be used for generating a page that shows a list. Each item of that list\nwill show the values of those attributes.\nFor generating the files:\nRight click your ETO file and click on CobiGen &gt; Generate as shown on the figure below.\nSelect the Ionic increments for generating as shown below. Increments group a set of templates for generating\ndifferent projects.\nIonic List used for generating the page containing the list.\nIonic devon4ng environments is for stating the server path.\nIonic i18n used for generating the different language translations for the translationService (currently English and Spanish).\nIonic routing adds an app-routing.module.ts file to allow navigation similar to the one available in Angular.\nIonic theme generates the variables.scss file which contains variables to style the application.\nNote\nBy default, the generated files will be placed inside &quot;devon4ng-ionic-application-template&quot;, next to the root of your project&#x2019;s folder.\nSee the image below to know where they are generated. For changing the generation path and the name of the application go to CobiGen_Templates/crud_ionic_client_app/cobigen.properties.\nNow that we have generated the files, lets start testing them:\nFirst change the SERVER_URL of your application. For doing that, modify src/environments/environments.ts, also modify src/environments/environments.android.ts (android) and src/environments/environments.prod.ts (production) if you want to test in different environments.\nCheck that there are no duplicated imports. Sometimes there are duplicated imports in src/app/app.module.ts.\nThis happens because the merger of CobiGen prefers to duplicate rather than to delete.\nRun npm install to install all the required dependencies.\nRun `ionic serve on your console.\nAfter following all these steps your application should start. However, remember that you will need your server to be running for access to the list page.\n"},{"id":537,"path":"../..\\..\\..\\..\\..\\xampp\\htdocs\\devonfw.github.io\\website\\pages\\docs/master-cobigen.asciidoc_how-to.html#howto_ionic-client-generation.asciidoc_running-it-on-android","type":"docs","title":"Running it on Android","body":"75.3.3.

Changes since Eclipse / Maven 3.x\nSince version 3.x the Eclipse and Maven plugins of CobiGen utilize the Java ServiceLoader mechanic to find and register plugins at runtime. To enable a new plugin to be discovered by this mechanic the following steps are needed:\ncreate the file META-INF/services/com.capgemini.cobigen.api.extension.GeneratorPluginActivator containing just the full qualified name of the class implementing the GeneratorPluginActivator interface, if the plugin provides a Merger and/or a TriggerInterpreter\ncreate the file META-INF/services/com.capgemini.cobigen.api.extension.TextTemplateEngine containing just the full qualified name of the class implementing the TextTemplateEngine interface, if provided by the plugin\ninclude META-INF into the target bundle (i.e. the folder META-INF has to be present in the target jar file)\nExample: Java Plugin\nThe java plugin provides both a Merger and a TriggerInterpreter. It contains therefore a com.capgemini.cobigen.api.extension.GeneratorPluginActivator file with the following content:\ncom.capgemini.cobigen.javaplugin.JavaPluginActivator\nThis makes the JavaPluginActivator class discoverable by the ServiceLoader at runtime.\nto properly include the plugin into the current system and use existing infrastructure, you need to add the plugin as a module in /cobigen/pom.xml (in case of a Merger/TriggerInterpreter providing plugin) and declare that as the plugin&#x2019;s parent in it&#x2019;s own pom.xml via\n&lt;parent&gt;\n&lt;groupId&gt;com.capgemini&lt;/groupId&gt;\n&lt;artifactId&gt;cobigen-parent&lt;/artifactId&gt;\n&lt;version&gt;dev-SNAPSHOT&lt;/version&gt;\n&lt;/parent&gt;\nor /cobigen/cobigen-templateengines/pom.xml (in case of a Merger/TriggerInterpreter providing plugin) and declare that as the plugin&#x2019;s parent in it&#x2019;s own pom.xml via\n&lt;parent&gt;\n&lt;groupId&gt;com.capgemini&lt;/groupId&gt;\n&lt;artifactId&gt;cobigen-tempeng-parent&lt;/artifactId&gt;\n&lt;version&gt;dev-SNAPSHOT&lt;/version&gt;\n&lt;/parent&gt;\nIf the plugin provides both just use the /cobigen/pom.xml.\nThe dependencies of the plugin are included in the bundle\nTo make the plugin available to the Eclipse plugin it must be included into the current compositeContent.xml and compositeArtifacts.xml files. Both files are located in http://de-mucevolve02/files/cobigen/updatesite/{experimental|nightly|stable}. To do so, add an &lt;child&gt; entry to the &lt;children&gt; tag in both files and adapt the size attribute to match the new number of references. The location attribute of the new &lt;child&gt; tag needs to be the artifact id of the plugins pom.xml.\nExample: Java Plugin\nIn case of the Java plugin, the entry is\n&lt;child location=&quot;cobigen-javaplugin&quot;/&gt;\nDeployment\nFor the Maven Plugin\nExecute mvn clean deploy from the plugins project folder. You need to configure write access to the devon nexus (e.g in the CobiGen IDE via the variables-customized script)\nFor the Eclipse Plugin\nDepending on the kind of release you want to publish you can chose from the following maven profiles:\nexperimental is for, as the name suggests, experimental snapshot builds. In case of new plugins this is a good place to upload first drafts.\nnightly is for periodically CI deployment.\nstable is solely for releases.\nE.g. you want an experimental release you need to follow these steps:\n# Builds the Manifest and bundles the dependencies\nmvn clean package bundle:bundle -Pp2-bundle\n# Uses the created bundle and builds a p2 update site for it. Do NOT use clean\nmvn install bundle:bundle -Pp2-bundle,p2-build-mars,p2-build-experimental p2:site\n# Uploads the p2 update site to the experimental repository. Do NOT use clean\nmvn deploy -Pp2-build-mars,p2-build-experimental -Dp2.upload=experimental\nYou need write access to the iCSD file server configured (e.g in the CobiGen IDE via the variables-customized script).\n"},{"id":545,"path":"../..\\..\\..\\..\\..\\xampp\\htdocs\\devonfw.github.io\\website\\pages\\docs/master-cobigen.asciidoc_how-to.html#howto_create-external-plugin.asciidoc","type":"docs","title":"Introduction to CobiGen external plug-ins","body":"75.5.

General intuition\nBelow you will find a very high level description of how CobiGen worked in previous versions:\nBasically, when a new input file was sent to CobiGen, it called the input reader to create a model of it (see here an example of a model). That model was sent to the template engine.\nAfterwards, the template engine generated a new file which had to be merged with the original one. All this code was implemented in Java.\nOn the new version, we have implemented a handler (ExternalProcessHandler) which connects through TCP/IP connection to a server (normally on localhost:5000). This server can be implemented in any language (.Net, Node.js, Python&#x2026;&#x200B;) it just needs to implement a REST API defined here. The most important services are the input reading and merging:\nCobiGen acts as a client that sends requests to the server in order to read the input file and create a model. The model is returned to the template engine so that it generates a new file. Finally, it is sent back to get merged with the original file.\n"},{"id":547,"path":"../..\\..\\..\\..\\..\\xampp\\htdocs\\devonfw.github.io\\website\\pages\\docs/master-cobigen.asciidoc_how-to.html#howto_create-external-plugin.asciidoc_how-to-create-new-external-plug-in","type":"docs","title":"How to create new external plug-in","body":"75.5.2. How to create new external plug-in\nThe creation of a new plug-in consists mainly in three steps:\nCreation of the server (external process).\nCreation of a CobiGen plug-in.\nCreation of templates.\nServer (external process)\nThe server can be programmed in any language that is able to implement REST services endpoints. The API that needs to implement is defined with this contract. You can paste the content to https://editor.swagger.io/ for a better look.\nWe have already created a NestJS server that implements the API defined above. You can find the code here which you can use as an example.\nAs you can see, the endpoints have the following naming convention: processmanagement/todoplugin/nameOfService where you will have to change todo to your plug-in name (e.g. rustplugin, pyplugin, goplugin&#x2026;&#x200B;)\nWhen implementing service getInputModel which returns a model from the input file there are only two restrictions:\nA path key must be added. Its value can be the full path of the input file or just the file name. It is needed because in CobiGen there is a batch mode, in which you can have multiple input objects inside the same input file. You do not need to worry about batch mode for now.\nOn the root of your model, for each found key that is an object (defined with brackets [{}]), CobiGen will try to use it as an input object. For example, this could be a valid model:\n{\n&quot;path&quot;: &quot;example/path/employee.entity.ts&quot;\n&quot;classes&quot;: [\n{\n&quot;identifier&quot;: &quot;Employee&quot;,\n&quot;modifiers&quot;: [\n&quot;export&quot;\n],\n&quot;decorators&quot;: [\n{\n&quot;identifier&quot;: {\n&quot;name&quot;: &quot;Entity&quot;,\n&quot;module&quot;: &quot;typeorm&quot;\n},\n&quot;isCallExpression&quot;: true\n}\n],\n&quot;properties&quot;: [\n{\n&quot;identifier&quot;: &quot;id&quot;,\n...\n...\n...\n}]\n&quot;interfaces&quot;: [{\n...\n}]\n}\nFor this model, CobiGen would use as input objects all the classes and interfaces defined. On the templates we would be able to do model.classes[0].identifier to get the class name. These input objects depend on the language, therefore you can use any key.\nIn order to test the server, you will have to deploy it on your local machine (localhost), default port is 5000. If that port is already in use, you can deploy it on higher port values (5001, 5002&#x2026;&#x200B;). Nevertheless, we explain later the testing process as you need to complete the next step before.\nImportant\nYour server must accept one argument when running it. The argument will be the port number (as an integer). This will be used for CobiGen in order to handle blocked ports when deploying your server. Check this code to see how we implemented that argument on our NestJS server.\nCobiGen plug-in\nYou will have to create a new CobiGen plug-in that connects to the server. But do not worry, you will not have to implement anything new. We have a CobiGen plug-in template available, the only changes needed are renaming files and setting some properties on the pom.xml. Please follow these steps:\nGet the CobiGen plug-in template from here. It is a template repository (new GitHub feature), so you can click on &quot;Use this template&quot; as shown below:\nName your repo as cobigen-name-plugin where name can be python, rust, go&#x2026;&#x200B; In our case we will create a nest plug-in. It will create a repo with only one commit which contains all the needed files.\nClone your just created repo and import folder cobigen-todoplugin as a Maven project on any Java IDE, though we recommend you devonfw ;)\nRename all the todoplugin folders, files and class names to nameplugin. In our case nestplugin. In Eclipse you can easily rename by right clicking and then refactor &#x2192; rename:\nNote\nWe recommend you to select all the checkboxes\nRemember to change in src/main/java and src/test/java all the package, files and class names to use your plug-in name. The final result would be:\nNow we just need to change some strings, this is needed for CobiGen to register all the different plugins (they need unique names). In class TodoPluginActivator (in our case NestPluginActivator), change all the todo to your plug-in name. See below the 3 strings that need to be changed:\nFinally, we will change some properties from the pom.xml of the project. These properties define the server (external process) that is going to be used:\nInside pom.xml, press Ctrl + F to perform a find and replace operation. Replace all todo with your plugin name:\nWe are going to explain the server properties:\nartifactId: This is the name of your plug-in, that will be used for a future release on Maven Central.\nplugin.name: does not need to be changed as it uses the property from the artifactId. When connecting to the server, it will send a request to localhost:5000/{plugin.name}plugin/isConnectionReady, that is why it is important to use an unique name for the plug-in.\nserver.name: This defines how the server executable (.exe) file will be named. This .exe file contains all the needed resources for deploying the server. You can use any name you want.\nserver.version: You will specify here the server version that needs to be used. The .exe file will be named as {server.name}-{server.version}.exe.\nserver.url: This will define from where to download the server. We really recommend you using NPM which is a package manager we know it works well. We explain here how to release the server on NPM. This will download the .exe file for Windows.\nserver.url.linux: Same as before, but this should download the .exe file for Linux systems. If you do not want to implement a Linux version of the plug-in, just use the same URL from Windows or MacOS.\nserver.url.macos: Same as before, but this should download the .exe file for MacOS systems. If you do not want to implement a MacOS version of the plug-in, just use the same URL from Linux or Windows.\n"},{"id":548,"path":"../..\\..\\..\\..\\..\\xampp\\htdocs\\devonfw.github.io\\website\\pages\\docs/master-cobigen.asciidoc_how-to.html#howto_create-external-plugin.asciidoc_testing-phase","type":"docs","title":"Testing phase","body":"75.5.3.

We need to define templates:\nFork our CobiGen main repository, from here and clone it into your PC. Stay in the master branch and import into your IDE cobigen-templates\\templates-devon4j. Set the Java version of the project to 1.8 if needed.\nCreate a new folder on src/main/templates, this will contain all your templates. You can use any name, but please use underscores as separators. In our case, we created a folder crud_typescript_angular_client_app to generate an Angular client from a TypeORM entity (NodeJS entity).\nInside your folder, create a templates folder. As you can see below, the folder structure of the generated files starts here (the sources). Also we need a configuration file templates.xml that should be on the same level as templates/ folder. For now, copy and paste a templates.xml file from any of the templates folder.\nStart creating your own templates. Our default templates language is Freemarker, but you can also use Velocity. Add the extension to the file (.ftl) and start developing templates! You can find useful documentation here.\nAfter creating all the templates, you need to modify context.xml which is located on the root of src/main/templates. There you need to define a trigger, which is used for CobiGen to know when to trigger a plug-in. I recommend you to copy and paste the following trigger:\n&lt;trigger id=&quot;crud_typescript_angular_client_app&quot; type=&quot;nest&quot; templateFolder=&quot;crud_typescript_angular_client_app&quot;&gt;\n&lt;matcher type=&quot;fqn&quot; value=&quot;([^\\.]+).entity.ts&quot;&gt;\n&lt;variableAssignment type=&quot;regex&quot; key=&quot;entityName&quot; value=&quot;1&quot;/&gt;\n&lt;variableAssignment type=&quot;regex&quot; key=&quot;component&quot; value=&quot;1&quot;/&gt;\n&lt;variableAssignment type=&quot;constant&quot; key=&quot;domain&quot; value=&quot;demo&quot;/&gt;\n&lt;/matcher&gt;\n&lt;/trigger&gt;\nChange templateFolder to your templates folder name. id you can use any, but it is recommendable to use the same as the template folder name. type is the TRIGGER_TYPE we defined above on the NestPluginActivator class. On matcher just change the value: ([^\\.]+).entity.ts means that we will only accept input files that contain &quot;anyString.entity.ts&quot;. This improves usability, so that users only generate using the correct input files. You will find more info about variableAssignment here.\nFinally, is time to configure templates.xml. It is needed for organizing templates into increments, please take a look into this documentation.\nTesting templates\nWhen you have finished your templates you will like to test them. On the templates-devon4j pom.xml remove the SNAPSHOT from the version (in our case the version will be 3.1.8). Run mvn clean install -DskipTests on the project. We skip tests because you need special permissions to download artifacts from our Nexus. Remember the version that has just been installed:\nNote\nWe always recommend using the devonfw console, which already contains a working Maven version.\nNow we have your last version of the templates ready to be used. We need to use that latest version in CobiGen. We will use the CobiGen CLI that you will find in your cloned repo, at cobigen-cli/cli. Import the project into your IDE.\nInside the project, go to src/main/resources/pom.xml. This pom.xml is used on runtime in order to install all the CobiGen plug-ins and templates. Add there your latest templates version and the previously created plug-in:\nAfterwards, run mvn clean install -DskipTests and CobiGen will get your plug-ins. Now you have three options to test templates:\nUsing Eclipse run as:\nInside Eclipse, you can run the CobiGen-CLI as a Java application. Right click class CobiGenCLI.java &#x2192; run as &#x2192; run configurations&#x2026;&#x200B; and create a new Java application as shown below:\nThat will create a CobiGenCLI configuration where we can set arguments to the CLI. Let&#x2019;s first begin with showing the CLI version, which should print a list of all plug-ins, including ours.\n...\nname:= propertyplugin version = 2.0.0\nname:= jsonplugin version = 2.0.0\nname:= templates-devon4j version = 3.1.8\nname:= nestplugin version = 1.0.0\n...\nIf that worked, now you can send any arguments to the CLI in order to generate with your templates. Please follow this guide that explains all the CLI commands.\nModify the already present JUnit tests on the CLI project: They test the generation of templates from multiple plug-ins, you can add your own tests and input files.\nUse the CLI jar to execute commands:\nThe mvn clean install -DskipTests command will have created a Cobigen.jar inside your target folder (cobigen-cli/cli/target). Open the jar with any unzipper and extract to the current location class-loader-agent.jar, cobigen.bat and cg.bat:\nNow you can run any CobiGen CLI commands using a console. This guide explains all the CLI commands.\n"},{"id":551,"path":"../..\\..\\..\\..\\..\\xampp\\htdocs\\devonfw.github.io\\website\\pages\\docs/master-cobigen.asciidoc_how-to.html#howto_devon4net.asciidoc_navydevon4net-cobigen-guide","type":"docs","title":"How to update CobiGen","body":"75.5.6. devon4net Cobigen Guide\nOverview\nIn this guide we will explain how to generate a new WebApi project from an OpenAPI 3.0.0 specification. This means that we are going to use a &#x201C;contract first&#x201D; strategy. This is going to be possible due to these type of files that contain all the information about entities, operations, etc&#x2026;\nIn order to make it work we are using CobiGen, a powerful tool for generating source code. CobiGen allows users to generate all the structure and code of the components, helping to save a lot of time otherwise waisted on repetitive tasks.\nGetting things ready\ndevonfw-ide\nFirst, we will install the devonfw-ide. It is a tool that will setup your IDE within minutes. Please follow the install guide here.\ndevon4net Templates\nWe are going to use the template of devon4net as a base to generate all the code, so what we have to do now is to download said template using the following steps.\nFirst of all you have to set up all the environment for .NET, you can do this using the following tutorial. Next we are going to create a new folder where we want to have the WebAPI project, lastly we are going to open the terminal there.\nType the following:\ndotnet new -i Devon4Net.WebAPI.Template\nand then:\ndotnet new Devon4NetAPI\nOpenAPI File\nIn order to let CobiGen generate all the files, we first have to make some modifications to our OpenAPI file.\nIt is obligatory to put the &#x201C;x-rootpackage&#x201D; tag to indicate where CobiGen will place the generated files as well as the &quot;x-component&quot; tags for each component, keep in mind that due to CobiGen&#x2019;s limitations each component must have its own entity.\nYou can read more information about how to configure your OpenAPI file and a working example here.\nGenerating files\nCobigen allow us to generate the files in two different ways. One of them is using Eclipse which it can be done by using the its grafical interface. The other way to generate the code is using the Cobigen CLI tool.\nGenerating files through Eclipse\nIn order to generate the files using Eclipse we need to follow some simple steps.\nFirst we are going to import our basic devon4net WebAPI Project into Eclipse. to do so open Eclipse with the &#x201C;eclipse-main.bat&#x201D; file that can be found in the devon distribution root folder. Once we are inside of Eclipse we go to File &gt; Open projects from file system&#x2026;&#x200B; and, under &quot;Directory&quot;, search for your project.\nNext we copy our OpenAPI file into the root folder of the project.\nAnd then we right click on OpenAPI file and then select CobiGen &gt; Generate&#x2026;&#x200B; It will display a window like this:\nTo select all .NET features choose CRUD devon4net Server otherwise you can select only those that interest you.\nOnes you select all the files that you want to generate, click on the &#x201C;Finish&#x201D; button to generate all the source code.\nGenerating files through Cobigen CLI\nIn ordet to generate the files using the Cobigen CLI it is needed to do the following steps:\nGo to devonfw distribution folder\nRun console.bat, this will open a console.\nGo to the folder you downloaded the devon4net template and your yml file.\nRun the command:\ncobigen generate {yourOpenAPIFile}.yml\nA list of increments will be printed so that you can start the generation. It has to be selected CRUD devon4net Server increment.\nConfiguration\nData base\nCobigen is generating an empty context that has to be filled with manualy in order to be able to work with the database. The context can be found in [Project_Name]/Devon4Net.WebAPI.Implementation/Domain/Database/CobigenContext.cs.\nRun the application\nAfter the configuration of the database, open a terminal in path: [Project_Name]/Devon4Net.Application.WebAPI and then type:\ndotnet run\nThis will deploy our application in our localhost with the port 8082, so when you click here (https://localhost:8082/swagger) you can see, in swagger, all the services and the data model.\n75.6. How to update CobiGen\nIn order to update CobiGen from our devonfw distribution, we have two options:\nOpen Eclipse, click on Help &#x2192; Check for updates\nSelect all the CobiGen plugins listed and click on Next.\nIf this option is not working properly, then you can try the second option:\nOpen Eclipse, click on Help &#x2192; About Eclipse IDE:\nClick on Installation details:\nSelect all the CobiGen plugins and click on Update:\nAfter the update process finishes, remember to restart Eclipse.\n"},{"id":552,"path":"../..\\..\\..\\..\\..\\xampp\\htdocs\\devonfw.github.io\\website\\pages\\docs/master-cobigen.asciidoc_how-to.html#howto_update_cobigen.asciidoc_updating-templates","type":"docs","title":"Updating templates:","body":"75.6.1.

Layer specification\nIt is important to understand the distinction between layers and tiers. Layers describe the logical groupings of the functionality and components in an application; whereas tiers describe the physical distribution of the functionality and components on separate servers, computers, networks, or remote locations. Although both layers and tiers use the same set of names (presentation, business, services, and data), remember that only tiers imply a physical separation. It is quite common to locate more than one layer on the same physical machine (the same tier). You can think of the term tier as referring to physical distribution patterns such as two-tier, three-tier, and n-tier.\n&#x2014; Layered Application Guidelines\nMSDN Microsoft\nThe proposed architecture makes use of cooperating components called layers. Each layer contains a set of components capable to develop a specific functionality.\nThe next figure represents the different layers:\nFigure 75. High level architecture representation\nThe layers are separated in physical tiers making use of interfaces. This pattern makes possible to be flexible in different kind of projects maximizing performance and deployment strategies (synchronous/asynchronous access, security, component deployment in different environments, microservices&#x2026;&#x200B;). Another important point is to provide automated unit testing or test-driven development (TDD) facilities.\nApplication layer\nThe Application Layer encapsulates the different .Net projects and its resource dependencies and manages the user interaction depending on the project&#x2019;s nature.\nFigure 76. Net application stack\nThe provided application template implements an dotnet API application. Also integrates by default the Swagger client. This provides the possibility to share the contract with external applications (angular, mobile apps, external services&#x2026;&#x200B;).\nBusiness layer\nThe business layer implements the core functionality of the application and encapsulates the component&#x2019;s logic.\nThis layer provides the interface between the data transformation and the application exposition. This allow the data to be optimized and ready for different data consumers.\nThis layer may implement for each main entity the API controller, the entity related service and other classes to support the application logic.\nIn order to implement the service logic, the services class must follow the next specification:\npublic class Service&lt;TContext&gt; : IService where TContext: DbContext\nPE: devon4Net API template shows how to implement the TODOs service as follows:\npublic class TodoService: Service&lt;TodoContext&gt;, ITodoService\nWhere Service is the base service class to be inherited and have full access for the Unit of work, TodoContext is the TODOs database context and ITodoService is the interface of the service, which exposes the public extended methods to be implemented.\nData layer\nThe data layer orchestrates the data obtained between the Domain Layer and the Business Layer. Also transforms the data to be used more efficiently between layers.\nSo, if a service needs the help of another service or repository, the implemented Dependency Injection is the solution to accomplish the task.\nThe main aim of this layer is to implement the repository for each entity. The repository&#x2019;s interface is defined in the Domain layer.\nIn order to implement the repository logic, the repository class must follow the next specification:\nRepository&lt;T&gt; : IRepository&lt;T&gt; where T : class\nPE: devon4Net API template shows how to implement the TODOs repository as follows:\npublic class TodoRepository : Repository&lt;Todos&gt;, ITodoRepository\nWhere Repository is the the base repository class to be inherited and have full access for the basic CRUD operations, Todos is the entity defined in the database context. ITodoRepository is the interface of the repository, which exposes the public extended methods to be implemented.\nPlease remember that &lt;T&gt; is the mapped class which reference the entity from the database context. This abstraction allows to write services implementation with different database contexts\nDomain layer\nThe domain layer provides access to data directly exposed from other systems. The main source is used to be a data base system. The provided template makes use of Entity Framework solution from Microsoft in order to achieve this functionality.\nTo make a good use of this technology, Repository Pattern has been implemented with the help of Unit Of Work pattern. Also, the use of generic types are makes this solution to be the most flexible.\nRegarding to data base source, each entity is mapped as a class. Repository pattern allows to use this mapped classes to access the data base via Entity framework:\npublic class UnitOfWork&lt;TContext&gt; : IUnitOfWork&lt;TContext&gt; where TContext : DbContext\nWhere &lt;T&gt; is the mapped class which reference the entity from the database.\nThe repository and unit of work patterns are create an abstraction layer between the data access layer and the business logic layer of an application.\nDomain Layer has no dependencies with other layers. It contains the Entities, datasources and the Repository Interfaces.\ndevon4Net architecture layer implementaion\nThe next picture shows how the devon4Net API template implements the architectured described in previous points:\nFigure 77. devon4Net architecture implementations\nCross-Cutting concerns\nCross-cutting provides the implementation functionality that spans layers. Each functionality is implemented through components able to work stand alone. This approach provides better reusability and maintainability.\nA common component set of cross cutting components include different types of functionality regarding to authentication, authorization, security, caching, configuration, logging, and communication.\n"},{"id":589,"path":"../..\\..\\..\\..\\..\\xampp\\htdocs\\devonfw.github.io\\website\\pages\\docs/master-devon4net.asciidoc_architecture-basics.html#architecture_guide.asciidoc_communication-between-layers-interfaces","type":"docs","title":"Communication between Layers: Interfaces","body":"23.1.3. Communication between Layers: Interfaces\nThe main target of the use of interfaces is to loose coupling between layers and minimize dependencies.\nPublic interfaces allow to hide implementation details of the components within the layers making use of dependency inversion.\nIn order to make this possible, we make use of Dependency Injection Pattern (implementation of dependency inversion) given by default in .Net Core.\nThe provided Data Layer contains the abstract classes to inherit from. All new repository and service classes must inherit from them, also the must implement their own interfaces.\nFigure 78.

This means that we are going to use a &#x201C;contract first&#x201D; strategy. This is going to be possible due to these type of files that contain all the information about entities, operations, etc&#x2026;\nIn order to make it work we are using CobiGen, a powerful tool for generating source code. CobiGen allows users to generate all the structure and code of the components, helping to save a lot of time otherwise waisted on repetitive tasks.\nGetting things ready\ndevonfw Distribution\nThe devonfw distributions can be obtained from the TeamForge releases library and are packaged in zips files that include all the needed tools, software and configurations.\nIt is not necessary to install nor configure anything. Just extracting the zip content is enough to have a fully functional devonfw. The only thing you have to do is run create-or-update-workspace.bat and then update-all-workspaces.bat to set up all the needed tools.\ndevon4net Templates\nWe are going to use the template of devon4net as a base to generate all the code, so what we have to do now is to download said template using the following steps.\nFirst of all you have to set up all the environment for .NET, you can do this using the following tutorial. Next we are going to create a new folder where we want to have the WebAPI project, lastly we are going to open the terminal there.\nType the following:\ndotnet new -i Devon4Net.WebAPI.Template\nand then:\ndotnet new Devon4NetAPI\nOpenAPI File\nIn order to let CobiGen generate all the files, we first have to make some modifications to our OpenAPI file.\nIt is obligatory to put the &#x201C;x-rootpackage&#x201D; tag to indicate where CobiGen will place the generated files as well as the &quot;x-component&quot; tags for each component, keep in mind that due to CobiGen&#x2019;s limitations each component must have its own entity.\nYou can read more information about how to configure your OpenAPI file and a working example here.\nGenerating files\nCobigen allow us to generate the files in two different ways. One of them is using Eclipse which it can be done by using the its grafical interface. The other way to generate the code is using the Cobigen CLI tool.\nGenerating files through Eclipse\nIn order to generate the files using Eclipse we need to follow some simple steps.\nFirst we are going to import our basic devon4net WebAPI Project into Eclipse. to do so open Eclipse with the &#x201C;eclipse-main.bat&#x201D; file that can be found in the devon distribution root folder. Once we are inside of Eclipse we go to File &gt; Open projects from file system&#x2026;&#x200B; and, under &quot;Directory&quot;, search for your project.\nNext we copy our OpenAPI file into the root folder of the project.\nAnd then we right click on OpenAPI file and then select CobiGen &gt; Generate&#x2026;&#x200B; It will display a window like this:\nTo select all .NET features choose CRUD devon4net Server otherwise you can select only those that interest you.\nOnes you select all the files that you want to generate, click on the &#x201C;Finish&#x201D; button to generate all the source code.\nGenerating files through Cobigen CLI\nIn ordet to generate the files using the Cobigen CLI it is needed to do the following steps:\nGo to devonfw distribution folder\nRun console.bat, this will open a console.\nGo to the folder you downloaded the devon4net template and your yml file.\nRun the command:\ncobigen generate {yourOpenAPIFile}.yml\nA list of increments will be printed so that you can start the generation. It has to be selected CRUD devon4net Server increment.\nConfiguration\nDependency Injection configuration\nAt this point it is needed to make some modifications in the code in order to configure correctly the server. To do so it is needed to locate the services and the repositories files that were created in Devon4Net.WebAPI.Implementation\nServices location:\nRepositories location:\nNow, we are going to open the following file Devon4Net.WebAPI.Implementation\\Configure\\DevonConfiguration.cs.\nIn there we have to add the Dependency Inyection for the services and the repositories that Cobigen has generated. The following image is an example of what is needed to add.\nMoreover it is needed to remove the last line in order to be able to run the application:\nthrow new NotImplementedException(...);\nConfigure data base\nCobigen is generating an empty context that has to be filled with manualy in order to be able to work with the database. The context can be found in [Project_Name]/Devon4Net.WebAPI.Implementation/Domain/Database/CobigenContext.cs.\nConfigure services\nIn order to finish the configuration of the services it is needed to go to each service file of the managements generated.\nIn there we will see some &quot;NotImplementedExceptions&quot;, so it is needed to read carefuly each coment inside of each exception in order to be able to use the service.

For example, in My Thai Star is created as follows:\npublic async Task&lt;IActionResult&gt; Login([FromBody]LoginDto loginDto)\n{\ntry\n{\nif (loginDto == null) return Ok();\nvar logged = await _loginService.LoginAsync(loginDto.UserName, loginDto.Password);\nif (logged)\n{\nvar user = await _loginService.GetUserByUserNameAsync(loginDto.UserName);\nvar encodedJwt = new JwtClientToken().CreateClientToken(_loginService.GetUserClaimsAsync(user));\nResponse.Headers.Add(&quot;Access-Control-Expose-Headers&quot;, &quot;Authorization&quot;);\nResponse.Headers.Add(&quot;Authorization&quot;, $&quot;{JwtBearerDefaults.AuthenticationScheme} {encodedJwt}&quot;);\nreturn Ok(encodedJwt);\n}\nelse\n{\nResponse.Headers.Clear();\nreturn StatusCode((int)HttpStatusCode.Unauthorized, &quot;Login Error&quot;);\n}\n}\ncatch (Exception ex)\n{\nreturn StatusCode((int)HttpStatusCode.InternalServerError, $&quot;{ex.Message} : {ex.InnerException}&quot;);\n}\n}\nIn My Thai Star the JWT will contain the user information such id, roles&#x2026;&#x200B;\nOnce you extend your controller with devon4NetJWTController you will have available these methods to simplify user management:\npublic interface Idevon4NetJWTController\n{\n// Gets the current user\nJwtSecurityToken GetCurrentUser();\n// Gets an specific assigned claim of current user\nClaim GetUserClaim(string claimName, JwtSecurityToken jwtUser = null);\n// Gets all the assigned claims of current user\nIEnumerable&lt;Claim&gt; GetUserClaims(JwtSecurityToken jwtUser = null);\n}\ndevon4Net.Infrastructure.MVC\nDescription\nCommon classes to extend controller functionality on API. Also provides support for paged results in devon4Net applications and automapper injected class.\nConfiguration\nInstall package on your solution:\nPM&gt; devon4Net.Infrastructure.MVC\nNotes\nThe generic class ResultObjectDto&lt;T&gt; provides a typed result object with pagination.\nThe extended class provides the following methods:\nResultObjectDto&lt;T&gt; GenerateResultDto&lt;T&gt;(int? page, int? size, int? total);\nResultObjectDto&lt;T&gt; GenerateResultDto&lt;T&gt;(List&lt;T&gt; result, int? page = null, int? size = null);\nGenerateResultDto provides typed ResultObjectDto object or a list of typed ResultObjectDto object. The aim of this methods is to provide a clean management for result objects and not repeating code through the different controller classes.\nThe following sample from My Thai Star shows how to use it:\npublic async Task&lt;IActionResult&gt; Search([FromBody] FilterDtoSearchObject filterDto)\n{\nif (filterDto == null) filterDto = new FilterDtoSearchObject();\ntry\n{\nvar dishList = await _dishService.GetDishListFromFilter(false, filterDto.GetMaxPrice(), filterDto.GetMinLikes(), filterDto.GetSearchBy(),filterDto.GetCategories(), -1);\nreturn new OkObjectResult(GenerateResultDto(dishList).ToJson());\n}\ncatch (Exception ex)\n{\nreturn StatusCode((int)HttpStatusCode.InternalServerError, $&quot;{ex.Message} : {ex.InnerException}&quot;);\n}\n}\ndevon4Net.Infrastructure.AOP\nDescription\nSimple AOP Exception handler for .Net Controller classes integrated with Serilog.\nConfiguration\nInstall package on your solution:\nPM&gt; Install-Package devon4Net.Domain.AOP\nAdd this line of code on ConfigureServices method on Startup.cs\nservices.AddAopAttributeService();\nNotes\nNow automatically your exposed API methods exposed on controller classes will be tracked on the methods:\nOnActionExecuting\nOnActionExecuted\nOnResultExecuting\nOnResultExecuted\nIf an exception occurs, a message will be displayed on log with the stack trace.\ndevon4Net.Infrastructure.Cors\nDescription\nEnables CORS configuration for devon4Net application. Multiple domains can be configured from configuration. Mandatory to web clients (p.e. Angular) to prevent making AJAX requests to another domain.\nCross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is a mechanism that uses additional HTTP headers to tell a browser to let a web application running at one origin (domain) have permission to access selected resources from a server at a different origin. A web application makes a cross-origin HTTP request when it requests a resource that has a different origin (domain, protocol, and port) than its own origin.\nPlease refer to this link to get more information about CORS and .Net core.\nConfiguration\nInstall package on your solution:\nPM&gt; devon4Net.Infrastructure.Cors\nYou can configure your Cors configuration on appsettings.{environment}.json:\nCorsPolicy: indicates the name of the policy. You can use this name to add security headers on your API exposed methods.\nOrigins: The allowed domains\nHeaders: The allowed headers such accept,content-type,origin,x-custom-header\nIf you specify the cors configuration as empty array, a default cors-policy will be used with all origins enabled:\n&quot;Cors&quot;: []\nOn the other hand, you can specify different Cors policies in your solution as follows:\n&quot;Cors&quot;: []\n[\n{\n&quot;CorsPolicy&quot;: &quot;CorsPolicy1&quot;,\n&quot;Origins&quot;: &quot;http:example.com,http:www.contoso.com&quot;,\n&quot;Headers&quot;: &quot;accept,content-type,origin,x-custom-header&quot;,\n&quot;Methods&quot;: &quot;GET,POST,HEAD&quot;,\n&quot;AllowCredentials&quot;: true\n},\n{\n&quot;CorsPolicy&quot;: &quot;CorsPolicy2&quot;,\n&quot;Origins&quot;: &quot;http:example.com,http:www.contoso.com&quot;,\n&quot;Headers&quot;: &quot;accept,content-type,origin,x-custom-header&quot;,\n&quot;Methods&quot;: &quot;GET,POST,HEAD&quot;,\n&quot;AllowCredentials&quot;: true\n}\n]\nNotes\nTo use CORS in your API methods, use the next notation:\n[EnableCors(&quot;YourCorsPolicy&quot;)]\npublic IActionResult Index() {\nreturn View();\n}\nif you want to disable the CORS check use the following annotation:\n[DisableCors]\npublic IActionResult Index() {\nreturn View();\n}\n"},{"id":611,"path":"../..\\..\\..\\..\\..\\xampp\\htdocs\\devonfw.github.io\\website\\pages\\docs/master-devon4net.asciidoc_packages.html#packages.asciidoc","type":"docs","title":"Required software","body":"29.2.

Key Concerns of Accessible Web Applications\nSemantic Markup - Allows the application to be understood on a more general level rather than just details of whats being rendered\nKeyboard Accessibility - Applications must still be usable when using only a keyboard\nVisual Assistance - color contrast, focus of elements and text representations of audio and events\nSemantic Markup\nIf you&#x2019;re creating custom element directives, Web Components or HTML in general, use native elements wherever possible to utilize built-in events and properties. Alternatively, use ARIA to communicate semantic meaning.\nHTML tags have attributes that providers extra context on what&#x2019;s being displayed on the browser. For example, the img tag&#x2019;s alt attribute lets the reader know what is being shown using a short description.However, native tags don&#x2019;t cover all cases. This is where ARIA fits in. ARIA attributes can provide context on what roles specific elements have in the application or on how elements within the document relate to each other.\nA modal component can be given the role of dialog or alertdialog to let the browser know that that component is acting as a modal. The modal component template can use the ARIA attributes aria-labelledby and aria-described to describe to readers what the title and purpose of the modal is.\n@Component({\nselector: &apos;ngc2-app&apos;,\ntemplate: `\n&lt;ngc2-notification-button\nmessage=&quot;Hello!&quot;\nlabel=&quot;Greeting&quot;\nrole=&quot;button&quot;&gt;\n&lt;/ngc2-notification-button&gt;\n&lt;ngc2-modal\n[title]=&quot;modal.title&quot;\n[description]=&quot;modal.description&quot;\n[visible]=&quot;modal.visible&quot;\n(close)=&quot;modal.close()&quot;&gt;\n&lt;/ngc2-modal&gt;\n`\n})\nexport class AppComponent {\nconstructor(private modal: ModalService) { }\n}\nnotification-button.component.ts\n@Component({\nselector: &apos;ngc2-modal&apos;,\ntemplate: `\n&lt;div\nrole=&quot;dialog&quot;\naria-labelledby=&quot;modal-title&quot;\naria-describedby=&quot;modal-description&quot;&gt;\n&lt;div id=&quot;modal-title&quot;&gt;{{title}}&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;p id=&quot;modal-description&quot;&gt;{{description}}&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;button (click)=&quot;close.emit()&quot;&gt;OK&lt;/button&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n`\n})\nexport class ModalComponent {\n...\n}\nKeyboard Accessibility\nKeyboard accessibility is the ability of your application to be interacted with using just a keyboard. The more streamlined the site can be used this way, the more keyboard accessible it is. Keyboard accessibility is one of the largest aspects of web accessibility since it targets:\nthose with motor disabilities who can&#x2019;t use a mouse\nusers who rely on screen readers and other assistive technology, which require keyboard navigation\nthose who prefer not to use a mouse\nFocus\nKeyboard interaction is driven by something called focus. In web applications, only one element on a document has focus at a time, and keypresses will activate whatever function is bound to that element.\nFocus element border can be styled with CSS using the outline property, but it should not be removed. Elements can also be styled using the :focus psuedo-selector.\nTabbing\nThe most common way of moving focus along the page is through the tab key. Elements will be traversed in the order they appear in the document outline - so that order must be carefully considered during development.\nThere is way change the default behaviour or tab order. This can be done through the tabindex attribute. The tabindex can be given the values:\n* less than zero - to let readers know that an element should be focusable but not keyboard accessible\n* 0 - to let readers know that that element should be accessible by keyboard\n* greater than zero - to let readers know the order in which the focusable element should be reached using the keyboard. Order is calculated from lowest to highest.\nTransitions\nThe majority of transitions that happen in an Angular application will not involve a page reload. This means that developers will need to carefully manage what happens to focus in these cases.\nFor example:\n@Component({\nselector: &apos;ngc2-modal&apos;,\ntemplate: `\n&lt;div\nrole=&quot;dialog&quot;\naria-labelledby=&quot;modal-title&quot;\naria-describedby=&quot;modal-description&quot;&gt;\n&lt;div id=&quot;modal-title&quot;&gt;{{title}}&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;p id=&quot;modal-description&quot;&gt;{{description}}&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;button (click)=&quot;close.emit()&quot;&gt;OK&lt;/button&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n`,\n})\nexport class ModalComponent {\nconstructor(private modal: ModalService, private element: ElementRef) { }\nngOnInit() {\nthis.modal.visible$.subscribe(visible =&gt; {\nif(visible) {\nsetTimeout(() =&gt; {\nthis.element.nativeElement.querySelector(&apos;button&apos;).focus();\n}, 0);\n}\n})\n}\n}\n"},{"id":624,"path":"../..\\..\\..\\..\\..\\xampp\\htdocs\\devonfw.github.io\\website\\pages\\docs/master-devon4ng.asciidoc_angular.html#guide-accessibility.asciidoc_visual-assistance","type":"docs","title":"Visual Assistance","body":"18.1.2. Visual Assistance\nOne large category of disability is visual impairment. This includes not just the blind, but those who are color blind or partially sighted, and require some additional consideration.\nColor Contrast\nWhen choosing colors for text or elements on a website, the contrast between them needs to be considered. For WCAG 2.0 AA, this means that the contrast ratio for text or visual representations of text needs to be at least 4.5:1. There are tools online to measure the contrast ratio such as this color contrast checker from WebAIM or be checked with using automation tests.\nVisual Information\nColor can help a user&#x2019;s understanding of information, but it should never be the only way to convey information to a user. For example, a user with red/green color-blindness may have trouble discerning at a glance if an alert is informing them of success or failure.\nAudiovisual Media\nAudiovisual elements in the application such as video, sound effects or audio (ie. podcasts) need related textual representations such as transcripts, captions or descriptions. They also should never auto-play and playback controls should be provided to the user.\n"},{"id":625,"path":"../..\\..\\..\\..\\..\\xampp\\htdocs\\devonfw.github.io\\website\\pages\\docs/master-devon4ng.asciidoc_angular.html#guide-accessibility.asciidoc_accessibility-with-angular-material","type":"docs","title":"Accessibility with Angular Material","body":"18.1.3. Accessibility with Angular Material\nThe a11y package provides a number of tools to improve accessibility. Import\nimport { A11yModule } from &apos;@angular/cdk/a11y&apos;;\nListKeyManager\nListKeyManager manages the active option in a list of items based on keyboard interaction. Intended to be used with components that correspond to a role=&quot;menu&quot; or role=&quot;listbox&quot; pattern . Any component that uses a ListKeyManager will generally do three things:\nCreate a @ViewChildren query for the options being managed.\nInitialize the ListKeyManager, passing in the options.\nForward keyboard events from the managed component to the ListKeyManager.\nEach option should implement the ListKeyManagerOption interface:\ninterface ListKeyManagerOption {\ndisabled?: boolean;\ngetLabel?(): string;\n}\nTypes of ListKeyManager\nThere are two varieties of ListKeyManager, FocusKeyManager and ActiveDescendantKeyManager.\nFocusKeyManager\nUsed when options will directly receive browser focus. Each item managed must implement the FocusableOption interface:\ninterface FocusableOption extends ListKeyManagerOption {\nfocus(): void;\n}\nActiveDescendantKeyManager\nUsed when options will be marked as active via aria-activedescendant. Each item managed must implement the Highlightable interface:\ninterface Highlightable extends ListKeyManagerOption {\nsetActiveStyles(): void;\nsetInactiveStyles(): void;\n}\nEach item must also have an ID bound to the listbox&#x2019;s or menu&#x2019;s aria-activedescendant.\nFocusTrap\nThe cdkTrapFocus directive traps Tab key focus within an element. This is intended to be used to create accessible experience for components like modal dialogs, where focus must be constrained. This directive is declared in A11yModule.\nThis directive will not prevent focus from moving out of the trapped region due to mouse interaction.\nFor example:\n&lt;div class=&quot;my-inner-dialog-content&quot; cdkTrapFocus&gt;\n&lt;!-- Tab and Shift + Tab will not leave this element. --&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\nRegions\nRegions can be declared explicitly with an initial focus element by using the cdkFocusRegionStart, cdkFocusRegionEnd and cdkFocusInitial DOM attributes. When using the tab key, focus will move through this region and wrap around on either end.\nFor example:\n&lt;a mat-list-item routerLink cdkFocusRegionStart&gt;Focus region start&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a mat-list-item routerLink&gt;Link&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a mat-list-item routerLink cdkFocusInitial&gt;Initially focused&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a mat-list-item routerLink cdkFocusRegionEnd&gt;Focus region end&lt;/a&gt;\nInteractivityChecker\nInteractivityChecker is used to check the interactivity of an element, capturing disabled, visible, tabbable, and focusable states for accessibility purposes.\nLiveAnnouncer\nLiveAnnouncer is used to announce messages for screen-reader users using an aria-live region.\nFor example:\n@Component({...})\nexport class MyComponent {\nconstructor(liveAnnouncer: LiveAnnouncer) {\nliveAnnouncer.announce(&quot;Hey Google&quot;);\n}\n}\nAPI reference for Angular CDK a11y\nAPI reference for Angular CDK a11y\n"},{"id":626,"path":"../..\\..\\..\\..\\..\\xampp\\htdocs\\devonfw.github.io\\website\\pages\\docs/master-devon4ng.asciidoc_angular.html#guide-angular-elements.asciidoc","type":"docs","title":"Angular Elements","body":"18.2.

How to use Angular Elements?\nIn a generalized way, a simple Angular component could be transformed to an Angular Element with this steps:\nInstalling Angular Elements\nThe first step is going to be install the library using our prefered packet manager:\nNPM\nnpm install @angular/elements\nYARN\nyarn add @angular/elements\nPreparing the components in the modules\nInside the app.module.ts, in addition to the normal declaration of the components inside declarations, the modules inside imports and the services inside providers, the components need to added in entryComponents. If there are components that have their own module, the same logic is going to be applied for them, only adding in the app.module.ts the components that dont have their own module. Here is an example of this:\n....\n@NgModule({\ndeclarations: [\nDishFormComponent,\nDishViewComponent\n],\nimports: [\nCoreModule, // Module containing Angular Materials\nFormsModule\n],\nentryComponents: [\nDishFormComponent,\nDishViewComponent\n],\nproviders: [DishShareService]\n})\n....\nAfter that is done, the constructor of the module is going to be modified to use injector and boostrap the application defining the components. This is going to allow the Angular Element to get the injections and to define a component tag that will be used later:\n....\n})\nexport class AppModule {\nconstructor(private injector: Injector) {\n}\nngDoBootstrap() {\nconst el = createCustomElement(DishFormComponent, {injector: this.injector});\ncustomElements.define(&apos;dish-form&apos;, el);\nconst elView = createCustomElement(DishViewComponent, {injector: this.injector});\ncustomElements.define(&apos;dish-view&apos;, elView);\n}\n}\n....\nA component example\nIn order to be able to use a component, @Input() and @Output() variables are used. These variables are going to be the ones that will allow the Angular Element to communicate with the framework/javascript:\nComponent html\n&lt;mat-card&gt;\n&lt;mat-grid-list cols=&quot;1&quot; rowHeight=&quot;100px&quot; rowWidth=&quot;50%&quot;&gt;\n&lt;mat-grid-tile colspan=&quot;1&quot; rowspan=&quot;1&quot;&gt;\n&lt;span&gt;{{ platename }}&lt;/span&gt;\n&lt;/mat-grid-tile&gt;\n&lt;form (ngSubmit)=&quot;onSubmit(dishForm)&quot; #dishForm=&quot;ngForm&quot;&gt;\n&lt;mat-grid-tile colspan=&quot;1&quot; rowspan=&quot;1&quot;&gt;\n&lt;mat-form-field&gt;\n&lt;input matInput placeholder=&quot;Name&quot; name=&quot;name&quot; [(ngModel)]=&quot;dish.name&quot;&gt;\n&lt;/mat-form-field&gt;\n&lt;/mat-grid-tile&gt;\n&lt;mat-grid-tile colspan=&quot;1&quot; rowspan=&quot;1&quot;&gt;\n&lt;mat-form-field&gt;\n&lt;textarea matInput placeholder=&quot;Description&quot; name=&quot;description&quot; [(ngModel)]=&quot;dish.description&quot;&gt;&lt;/textarea&gt;\n&lt;/mat-form-field&gt;\n&lt;/mat-grid-tile&gt;\n&lt;mat-grid-tile colspan=&quot;1&quot; rowspan=&quot;1&quot;&gt;\n&lt;button mat-raised-button color=&quot;primary&quot; type=&quot;submit&quot;&gt;Submit&lt;/button&gt;\n&lt;/mat-grid-tile&gt;\n&lt;/form&gt;\n&lt;/mat-grid-list&gt;\n&lt;/mat-card&gt;\nComponent ts\n@Component({\ntemplateUrl: &apos;./dish-form.component.html&apos;,\nstyleUrls: [&apos;./dish-form.component.scss&apos;]\n})\nexport class DishFormComponent implements OnInit {\n@Input() platename;\n@Input() platedescription;\n@Output()\nsubmitDishEvent = new EventEmitter();\nsubmitted = false;\ndish = {name: &apos;&apos;, description: &apos;&apos;};\nconstructor(public dishShareService: DishShareService) { }\nngOnInit() {\nthis.dish.name = this.platename;\nthis.dish.description = this.platedescription;\n}\nonSubmit(dishForm: NgForm): void {\nthis.dishShareService.createDish(dishForm.value.name, dishForm.value.description);\nthis.submitDishEvent.emit(&apos;dishSubmited&apos;);\n}\n}\nIn this file there are definitions of multiple variables that will be used as input and output. Since the input variables are going to be used directly by html, only lowercase and underscore strategies can be used for them. On the onSubmit(dishForm: NgForm) a service is used to pass this variables to another component. Finally, as a last thing, the selector inside @Component has been removed since a tag that will be used dynamically was already defined in the last step.\nSolving the error\nIn order to be able to use this Angular Element a Polyfills/Browser support related error needs to solved. This error can be solved in two ways:\nChanging the target\nOne solution is to change the target in tsconfig.json to es2015. This might not be doable for every application since maybe a specific target is required.\nInstalling Polyfaces\nAnother solution is to use AutoPollyfill. In order to do so, the library is going to be installed with a packet manager:\nYarn\nyarn add @webcomponents/webcomponentsjs\nNpm\nnpm install @webcomponents/webcomponentsjs\nAfter the packet manager has finished, inside the src folder a new file polyfills.ts is found. To solve the error, importing the corresponding adapter (custom-elements-es5-adapter.js) is necessary:\n....\n/***************************************************************************************************\n* APPLICATION IMPORTS\n*/\nimport &apos;@webcomponents/webcomponentsjs/custom-elements-es5-adapter.js&apos;;\n....\nIf you want to learn more about polyfills in angular you can do it here\nBuilding the Angular Element\nFirst, before building the Angular Element, every element inside that app component except the module need to be removed. After that, a bash script is created in the root folder,. This script will allow to put every necessary file into a js.\nng build &quot;projectName&quot; --prod --output-hashing=none &amp;&amp; cat dist/&quot;projectName&quot;/runtime.js dist/&quot;projectName&quot;/polyfills.js dist/&quot;projectName&quot;/scripts.js dist/&quot;projectName&quot;/main.js &gt; ./dist/&quot;projectName&quot;/&quot;nameWantedAngularElement&quot;.js\nAfter executing the bash script, it will generate inside the path dist/&quot;projectName&quot; a js file named &quot;nameWantedAngularElement&quot;.js and a css file.\nBuilding with ngx-build-plus (Recommended)\nThe library ngx-build-plus allows to add different options when building. In addition, it solves some errors that will occur when trying to use multiple angular elements in an application. In order to use it, yarn or npm can be used:\nYarn\nyarn add ngx-build-plus\nNpm\nnpm install ngx-build-plus\nIf you want to add it to a specific sub project in your projects folder, use the --project:\n.... ngx-build-plus --project &quot;project-name&quot;\nUsing this library and the following command, an isolated Angular Element which won&#x2019;t have conflict with others can be generated. This Angular Element will not have a polyfill so, the project where we use them will need to include a poliyfill with the Angular Element requirements.\nng build &quot;projectName&quot; --output-hashing none --single-bundle true --prod --bundle-styles false\nThis command will generate three things:\nThe main js bundle\nThe script js\nThe css\nThese files will be used later instead of the single js generated in the last step.\nExtra parameters\nHere are some extra useful parameters that ngx-build-plus provides:\n--keep-polyfills: This paremeter is going to allow us to keep the polyfills. This needs to be used with caution, avoiding using multiple different polyfills that could cause an error is necessary.\n--extraWebpackConfig webpack.extra.js: This parameter allows us to create a javascript file inside our Angular Elements project with the name of different libraries. Using webpack these libraries will not be included in the Angular Element. This is useful to lower the size of our Angular Element by removing libraries shared. Example:\nconst webpack = require(&apos;webpack&apos;);\nmodule.exports = {\n&quot;externals&quot;: {\n&quot;rxjs&quot;: &quot;rxjs&quot;,\n&quot;@angular/core&quot;: &quot;ng.core&quot;,\n&quot;@angular/common&quot;: &quot;ng.common&quot;,\n&quot;@angular/common/http&quot;: &quot;ng.common.http&quot;,\n&quot;@angular/platform-browser&quot;: &quot;ng.platformBrowser&quot;,\n&quot;@angular/platform-browser-dynamic&quot;: &quot;ng.platformBrowserDynamic&quot;,\n&quot;@angular/compiler&quot;: &quot;ng.compiler&quot;,\n&quot;@angular/elements&quot;: &quot;ng.elements&quot;,\n&quot;@angular/router&quot;: &quot;ng.router&quot;,\n&quot;@angular/forms&quot;: &quot;ng.forms&quot;\n}\n}\nNote\nIf some libraries are excluded from the `Angular Element` you will need to add the bundled umd files of those libraries manually.\nUsing the Angular Element\nThe Angular Element that got generated in the last step can be used in almost every framework. In this case, the Angular Element is going to be used in html:\nListing 17. Sample index.html version without ngx-build-plus\n&lt;html&gt;\n&lt;head&gt;\n&lt;link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; href=&quot;styles.css&quot;&gt;\n&lt;/head&gt;\n&lt;body&gt;\n&lt;div id=&quot;container&quot;&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;!--Use of the element non dynamically--&gt;\n&lt;!--&lt;plate-form platename=&quot;test&quot; platedescription=&quot;test&quot;&gt;&lt;/plate-form&gt;--&gt;\n&lt;script src=&quot;./devon4ngAngularElements.js&quot;&gt; &lt;/script&gt;\n&lt;script&gt;\nvar elContainer = document.getElementById(&apos;container&apos;);\nvar el= document.createElement(&apos;dish-form&apos;);\nel.setAttribute(&apos;platename&apos;,&apos;test&apos;);\nel.setAttribute(&apos;platedescription&apos;,&apos;test&apos;);\nel.addEventListener(&apos;submitDishEvent&apos;,(ev)=&gt;{\nvar elView= document.createElement(&apos;dish-view&apos;);\nelContainer.innerHTML = &apos;&apos;;\nelContainer.appendChild(elView);\n});\nelContainer.appendChild(el);\n&lt;/script&gt;\n&lt;/body&gt;\n&lt;/html&gt;\nListing 18. Sample index.html version with ngx-build-plus\n&lt;html&gt;\n&lt;head&gt;\n&lt;link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; href=&quot;styles.css&quot;&gt;\n&lt;/head&gt;\n&lt;body&gt;\n&lt;div id=&quot;container&quot;&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;!--Use of the element non dynamically--&gt;\n&lt;!--&lt;plate-form platename=&quot;test&quot; platedescription=&quot;test&quot;&gt;&lt;/plate-form&gt;--&gt;\n&lt;script src=&quot;./polyfills.js&quot;&gt; &lt;/script&gt; &lt;!-- Created using --keep-polyfills options --&gt;\n&lt;script src=&quot;./scripts.js&quot;&gt; &lt;/script&gt;\n&lt;script src=&quot;./main.js&quot;&gt; &lt;/script&gt;\n&lt;script&gt;\nvar elContainer = document.getElementById(&apos;container&apos;);\nvar el= document.createElement(&apos;dish-form&apos;);\nel.setAttribute(&apos;platename&apos;,&apos;test&apos;);\nel.setAttribute(&apos;platedescription&apos;,&apos;test&apos;);\nel.addEventListener(&apos;submitDishEvent&apos;,(ev)=&gt;{\nvar elView= document.createElement(&apos;dish-view&apos;);\nelContainer.innerHTML = &apos;&apos;;\nelContainer.appendChild(elView);\n});\nelContainer.appendChild(el);\n&lt;/script&gt;\n&lt;/body&gt;\n&lt;/html&gt;\nIn this html, the css generated in the last step is going to be imported inside the &lt;head&gt; and then, the javascript element is going to be imported at the end of the body. After that is done, There is two uses of Angular Elements in the html, one directly whith use of the @input() variables as parameters commented in the html:\n....\n&lt;!--Use of the element non dynamically--&gt;\n&lt;!--&lt;plate-form platename=&quot;test&quot; platedescription=&quot;test&quot;&gt;&lt;/plate-form&gt;--&gt;\n....\nand one dynamically inside the script:\n....\n&lt;script&gt;\nvar elContainer = document.getElementById(&apos;container&apos;);\nvar el= document.createElement(&apos;dish-form&apos;);\nel.setAttribute(&apos;platename&apos;,&apos;test&apos;);\nel.setAttribute(&apos;platedescription&apos;,&apos;test&apos;);\nel.addEventListener(&apos;submitDishEvent&apos;,(ev)=&gt;{\nvar elView= document.createElement(&apos;dish-view&apos;);\nelContainer.innerHTML = &apos;&apos;;\nelContainer.appendChild(elView);\n});\nelContainer.appendChild(el);\n&lt;/script&gt;\n....\nThis javascript is an example of how to create dynamically an Angular Element inserting attributed to fill our @Input() variables and listen to the @Output() that was defined earlier. This is done with:\nel.addEventListener(&apos;submitDishEvent&apos;,(ev)=&gt;{\nvar elView= document.createElement(&apos;dish-view&apos;);\nelContainer.innerHTML = &apos;&apos;;\nelContainer.appendChild(elView);\n});\nThis allows javascript to hook with the @Output() event emitter that was defined. When this event gets called, another component that was defined gets inserted dynamically.\n"},{"id":631,"path":"../..\\..\\..\\..\\..\\xampp\\htdocs\\devonfw.github.io\\website\\pages\\docs/master-devon4ng.asciidoc_angular.html#guide-angular-elements.asciidoc_angular-element-within-another-angular-project","type":"docs","title":"Angular Element within another Angular project","body":"18.2.5.

Including it on the test, will allow to perform unitary tests.\n{\n....\n&quot;architect&quot;: {\n....\n&quot;build&quot;: {\n....\n&quot;styles&quot;: [\n....\n&quot;src/assets/css/devon4ngAngularElements.css&quot;\n....\n]\n....\n&quot;scripts&quot;: [\n&quot;src/assets/js/devon4ngAngularElements.js&quot;\n]\n....\n}\n....\n&quot;test&quot;: {\n....\n&quot;styles&quot;: [\n....\n&quot;src/assets/css/devon4ngAngularElements.css&quot;\n....\n]\n....\n&quot;scripts&quot;: [\n&quot;src/assets/js/devon4ngAngularElements.js&quot;\n]\n....\n}\n}\n}\nBy declaring the files in the angular.json angular will take care of including them in a proper way.\nUsing Angular Element\nThere are two ways that Angular Element can be used:\nCreate component dynamicly\nIn order to add the component in a dynamic way, first adding a container is necessary:\napp.component.html\n....\n&lt;div id=&quot;container&quot;&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n....\nWith this container created, inside the app.component.ts a method is going to be created. This method is going to find the container, create the dynamic element and append it into the container.\napp.component.ts\nexport class AppComponent implements OnInit {\n....\nngOnInit(): void {\nthis.createComponent();\n}\n....\ncreateComponent(): void {\nconst container = document.getElementById(&apos;container&apos;);\nconst component = document.createElement(&apos;dish-form&apos;);\ncontainer.appendChild(component);\n}\n....\nUsing it directly\nIn order to use it directly on the templates, in the app.module.ts the CUSTOM_ELEMENTS_SCHEMA needs to be added:\n....\nimport { NgModule, CUSTOM_ELEMENTS_SCHEMA } from &apos;@angular/core&apos;;\n....\n@NgModule({\n....\nschemas: [ CUSTOM_ELEMENTS_SCHEMA ],\nThis is going to allow the use of the Angular Element in the templates directly:\napp.component.html\n....\n&lt;div id=&quot;container&quot;&gt;\n&lt;dish-form&gt;&lt;/dish-form&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n"},{"id":632,"path":"../..\\..\\..\\..\\..\\xampp\\htdocs\\devonfw.github.io\\website\\pages\\docs/master-devon4ng.asciidoc_angular.html#guide-angular-lazy-loading.asciidoc","type":"docs","title":"Angular Lazy loading","body":"18.3. Angular Lazy loading\nWhen the development of an application starts, it just contains a small set of features so the app usually loads fast.

Those pages can be loaded at start or on demand.\n"},{"id":633,"path":"../..\\..\\..\\..\\..\\xampp\\htdocs\\devonfw.github.io\\website\\pages\\docs/master-devon4ng.asciidoc_angular.html#guide-angular-lazy-loading.asciidoc_an-example-with-angular","type":"docs","title":"An example with Angular","body":"18.3.1. An example with Angular\nTo explain how lazy loading is implemented using angular, a basic sample app is going to be developed. This app will consist in a window named &quot;level 1&quot; that contains two buttons that redirects to other windows in a &quot;second level&quot;. It is a simple example, but useful to understand the relation between angular modules and lazy loading.\nFigure 19. Levels app structure.\nThis graphic shows that modules acts as gates to access components &quot;inside&quot; them.\nBecause the objective of this guide is related mainly with logic, the html structure and scss styles are less relevant, but the complete code can be found as a sample here.\nImplementation\nFirst write in a console ng new level-app --routing, to generate a new project called level-app including an app-routing.module.ts file (--routing flag).\nIn the file app.component.html delete all the content except the router-outlet tag.\nListing 19. File app.component.html\n&lt;router-outlet&gt;&lt;/router-outlet&gt;\nThe next steps consists on creating features modules.\nrun ng generate module first --routing to generate a module named first.\nrun ng generate module first/second-left --routing to generate a module named second-left under first.\nrun ng generate module first/second-right --routing to generate a module second-right under first.\nrun ng generate component first/first to generate a component named first inside the module first.\nrun ng generate component first/second-left/content to generate a component content inside the module second-left.\nrun ng generate component first/second-right/content to generate a component content inside the module second-right.\nTo move between components we have to configure the routes used:\nIn app-routing.module.ts add a path &apos;first&apos; to FirstComponent and a redirection from &apos;&apos; to &apos;first&apos;.\nListing 20. File app-routing.module.ts.\n...\nimport { FirstComponent } from &apos;./first/first/first.component&apos;;\nconst routes: Routes = [\n{\npath: &apos;first&apos;,\ncomponent: FirstComponent\n},\n{\npath: &apos;&apos;,\nredirectTo: &apos;first&apos;,\npathMatch: &apos;full&apos;,\n},\n];\n@NgModule({\nimports: [RouterModule.forRoot(routes)],\nexports: [RouterModule],\n})\nexport class AppRoutingModule {}\nIn app.module.ts import the module which includes FirstComponent.\nListing 21. File app.module.ts\n....\nimport { FirstModule } from &apos;./first/first.module&apos;;\n@NgModule({\n...\nimports: [\n....\nFirstModule\n],\n...\n})\nexport class AppModule { }\nIn first-routing.module.ts add routes that direct to the content of SecondRightModule and SecondLeftModule. The content of both modules have the same name so, in order to avoid conflicts the name of the components are going to be changed using as ( original-name as new-name).\nListing 22. File first-routing.module.ts\n...\nimport { ContentComponent as ContentLeft} from &apos;./second-left/content/content.component&apos;;\nimport { ContentComponent as ContentRight} from &apos;./second-right/content/content.component&apos;;\nimport { FirstComponent } from &apos;./first/first.component&apos;;\nconst routes: Routes = [\n{\npath: &apos;&apos;,\ncomponent: FirstComponent\n},\n{\npath: &apos;first/second-left&apos;,\ncomponent: ContentLeft\n},\n{\npath: &apos;first/second-right&apos;,\ncomponent: ContentRight\n}\n];\n@NgModule({\nimports: [RouterModule.forChild(routes)],\nexports: [RouterModule]\n})\nexport class FirstRoutingModule { }\nIn first.module.ts import SecondLeftModule and SecondRightModule.\nListing 23. File first.module.ts\n...\nimport { SecondLeftModule } from &apos;./second-left/second-left.module&apos;;\nimport { SecondRightModule } from &apos;./second-right/second-right.module&apos;;\n@NgModule({\n...\nimports: [\n...\nSecondLeftModule,\nSecondRightModule,\n]\n})\nexport class FirstModule { }\nUsing the current configuration, we have a project that loads all the modules in a eager way. Run ng serve to see what happens.\nFirst, during the compilation we can see that just a main file is built.\nFigure 20. Compile eager.\nIf we go to http//localhost:4200/first and open developer options (F12 on Chrome), it is found that a document named &quot;first&quot; is loaded.\nFigure 21. First level eager.\nIf we click on [Go to right module] a second level module opens, but there is no &apos;second-right&apos; document.\nFigure 22. Second level right eager.\nBut, typing the url directly will load &apos;second-right&apos; but no &apos;first&apos;, even if we click on [Go back]\nFigure 23. Second level right eager direct url.\nModifying an angular application to load its modules lazily is easy, you have to change the routing configuration of the desired module (for example FirstModule).\nListing 24. File app-routing.module.ts.\nconst routes: Routes = [\n{\npath: &apos;first&apos;,\nloadChildren: () =&gt; import(&apos;./first/first.module&apos;).then(m =&gt; m.FirstModule),\n},\n{\npath: &apos;&apos;,\nredirectTo: &apos;first&apos;,\npathMatch: &apos;full&apos;,\n},\n];\n@NgModule({\nimports: [RouterModule.forRoot(routes)],\nexports: [RouterModule],\n})\nexport class AppRoutingModule {}\nNotice that instead of loading a component, you dynamically import it in a loadChildren attribute because modules acts as gates to access components &quot;inside&quot; them. Updating the app to load lazily has four consecuences:\nNo component attribute.\nNo import of FirstComponent.\nFirstModule import has to be removed from the imports array at app.module.ts.\nChange of context.\nIf we check first-routing.module.ts again, the can see that the path for ContentLeft and ContentRight is set to &apos;first/second-left&apos; and &apos;first/second-right&apos; respectively, so writing &apos;http//localhost:4200/first/second-left&apos; will redirect us to ContentLeft. However, after loading a module with loadChildren setting the path to &apos;second-left&apos; and &apos;second-right&apos; is enough because it adquires the context set by AppRoutingModule.\nListing 25. File first-routing.module.ts\nconst routes: Routes = [\n{\npath: &apos;&apos;,\ncomponent: FirstComponent\n},\n{\npath: &apos;second-left&apos;,\ncomponent: ContentLeft\n},\n{\npath: &apos;second-right&apos;,\ncomponent: ContentRight\n}\n];\nIf we go to &apos;first&apos; then FirstModule is situated in &apos;/first&apos; but also its children ContentLeft and ContentRight, so it is not necessary to write in their path &apos;first/second-left&apos; and &apos;first/second-right&apos;, because that will situate the components on &apos;first/first/second-left&apos; and &apos;first/first/second-right&apos;.\nFigure 24. First level lazy wrong path.\nWhen we compile an app with lazy loaded modules, files containing them will be generated\nFigure 25. First level lazy compilation.\nAnd if we go to developer tools &#x2192; network, we can find those modules loaded (if they are needed).\nFigure 26. First level lazy.\nTo load the component ContentComponent of SecondLeftModule lazily, we have to load SecondLeftModule as a children of FirstModule:\nChange component to loadChildren and reference SecondLeftModule.\nListing 26. File first-routing.module.ts.\nconst routes: Routes = [\n{\npath: &apos;&apos;,\ncomponent: FirstComponent\n},\n{\npath: &apos;second-left&apos;,\nloadChildren: () =&gt; import(&apos;./second-left/second-left.module&apos;).then(m =&gt; m.SecondLeftModule),\n},\n{\npath: &apos;second-right&apos;,\ncomponent: ContentRight\n}\n];\nRemove SecondLeftModule at first.component.ts\nRoute the components inside SecondLeftModule. Without this step nothing would be displayed.\nListing 27. File second-left-routing.module.ts.\n...\nimport { ContentComponent } from &apos;./content/content.component&apos;;\nconst routes: Routes = [\n{\npath: &apos;&apos;,\ncomponent: ContentComponent\n}\n];\n@NgModule({\nimports: [RouterModule.forChild(routes)],\nexports: [RouterModule]\n})\nexport class SecondLeftRoutingModule { }\nrun ng serve to generate files containing the lazy modules.\nFigure 27.

How to build a library\nIn this section, a library is going to be build step by step.\nCreating an empty application\nFirst, using Angular CLI we are going to generate a empty application which will be later filled with the generated library. In order to do so, Angular CLI allows us to add to ng new &quot;application-name&quot; an option (--create-application). This option is going to tell Angular CLI not to create the initial app project. This is convenient since a library is going to be generated in later steps. Using this command ng new &quot;application-name&quot; --create-application=false an empty project with the name wanted is created.\nng new &quot;application-name&quot; --create-application=false\nGenerating a library\nAfter generating an empty application, a library is going to be generated. Inside the folder of the project, the Angular CLI command ng generate library &quot;library-name&quot; is going to generate the library as a project (projects/&quot;library-name&quot;). As an addition, the option --prefix=&quot;library-prefix-wanted&quot; allows us to switch the default prefix that Angular generated with (lib). Using the option to change the prefix the command will look like this ng generate library &quot;library-name&quot; --prefix=&quot;library-prefix-wanted&quot;.\nng generate library &quot;library-name&quot; --prefix=&quot;library-prefix-wanted&quot;\nGenerating/Modifying in our library\nIn the last step we generated a library. This generates automaticly a module,service and component inside (projects/&quot;library-name&quot;) that we can modify adding new methods, components etc that we want to use in other projects. We can generate other elements, using the usual Angular CLI generate commands adding the option --project=&quot;library-name&quot; is going to allow to generate elements within our project . An example of this is: ng generate service &quot;name&quot; --project=&quot;library-name&quot;.\nng generate &quot;element&quot; &quot;name&quot; --project=&quot;library-name&quot;\nExporting the generated things\nInside the library (projects/&quot;library-name) theres a public_api.ts which is the file that exports the elements inside the library. In case we generated other things, that file needs to be modified adding the extra exports with the generated elements. In addition, changing the library version is possible in the file package.json.\nBuilding our library\nOnce we added the necessary exports, in order to use the library in other applications, we need to build the library. The command ng build &quot;library-name&quot; is going to build the library, generating in &quot;project-name&quot;/dist/&quot;library-name&quot; the necessary files.\nng build &quot;library-name&quot;\nPacking the library\nIn this step we are going to pack the build library. In order to do so, we need to go inside dist/&quot;library-name&quot; and then run either npm pack or yarn pack to generate a &quot;library-name-version.tgz&quot; file.\nListing 28. Packing using npm\nnpm pack\nListing 29. Packing using yarn\nyarn pack\nPublishing to npm repository (optional)\nAdd a README.md and LICENSE file. The text inside README.md will be used in you npm package web page as documentation.\nrun npm adduser if you do not have a npm account to create it, otherwise run npm login and introduce your credentials.\nrun npm publish inside dist/&quot;library-name&quot; folder.\nCheck that the library is published: https://npmjs.com/package/library-name\nInstalling our library in other projects\nIn this step we are going to install/add the library on other projects.\nnpm\nIn order to add the library in other applications, there are two ways:\nOption 1: From inside the application where the library is going to get used, using the command npm install &quot;path-to-tgz&quot;/&quot;library-name-version.tgz&quot; allows us to install the .tgz generated in Packing the library.\nOption 2: run npm install &quot;library-name&quot; to install it from npm repository.\nyarn\nTo add the package using yarn:\nOption 1: From inside the application where the library is going to get used, using the command yarn add &quot;path-to-tgz&quot;/&quot;library-name-version.tgz&quot; allows us to install the .tgz generated in Packing the library.\nOption 2: run yarn add &quot;library-name&quot; to install it from npm repository.\nUsing the library\nFinally, once the library was installed with either packet manager, you can start using the elements from inside like they would be used in a normal element inside the application. Example app.component.ts:\nimport { Component, OnInit } from &apos;@angular/core&apos;;\nimport { MyLibraryService } from &apos;my-library&apos;;\n@Component({\nselector: &apos;app-root&apos;,\ntemplateUrl: &apos;./app.component.html&apos;,\nstyleUrls: [&apos;./app.component.scss&apos;]\n})\nexport class AppComponent implements OnInit {\ntoUpper: string;\nconstructor(private myLibraryService: MyLibraryService) {}\ntitle = &apos;devon4ng library test&apos;;\nngOnInit(): void {\nthis.toUpper = this.myLibraryService.firstLetterToUpper(&apos;test&apos;);\n}\n}\nExample app.component.html:\n&lt;!--The content below is only a placeholder and can be replaced.--&gt;\n&lt;div style=&quot;text-align:center&quot;&gt;\n&lt;h1&gt;\nWelcome to {{ title }}!\n&lt;/h1&gt;\n&lt;img width=&quot;300&quot; alt=&quot;Angular Logo&quot; src=&quot;data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZpZXdCb3g9IjAgMCAyNTAgMjUwIj4KICAgIDxwYXRoIGZpbGw9IiNERDAwMzEiIGQ9Ik0xMjUgMzBMMzEuOSA2My4ybDE0LjIgMTIzLjFMMTI1IDIzMGw3OC45LTQzLjcgMTQuMi0xMjMuMXoiIC8+CiAgICA8cGF0aCBmaWxsPSIjQzMwMDJGIiBkPSJNMTI1IDMwdjIyLjItLjFWMjMwbDc4LjktNDMuNyAxNC4yLTEyMy4xTDEyNSAzMHoiIC8+CiAgICA8cGF0aCAgZmlsbD0iI0ZGRkZGRiIgZD0iTTEyNSA1Mi4xTDY2LjggMTgyLjZoMjEuN2wxMS43LTI5LjJoNDkuNGwxMS43IDI5LjJIMTgzTDEyNSA1Mi4xem0xNyA4My4zaC0zNGwxNy00MC45IDE3IDQwLjl6IiAvPgogIDwvc3ZnPg==&quot;&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Here is my library service being used: {{toUpper}}&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;lib-my-library&gt;&lt;/lib-my-library&gt;\nExample app.module.ts:\nimport { BrowserModule } from &apos;@angular/platform-browser&apos;;\nimport { NgModule } from &apos;@angular/core&apos;;\nimport { AppRoutingModule } from &apos;./app-routing.module&apos;;\nimport { AppComponent } from &apos;./app.component&apos;;\nimport { MyLibraryModule } from &apos;my-library&apos;;\n@NgModule({\ndeclarations: [\nAppComponent\n],\nimports: [\nBrowserModule,\nAppRoutingModule,\nMyLibraryModule\n],\nproviders: [],\nbootstrap: [AppComponent]\n})\nexport class AppModule { }\nThe result from using the library:\ndevon4ng libraries\nIn devonfw/devon4ng-library you can find some useful libraries:\nAuthorization module: This devon4ng Angular module adds rights-based authorization to your Angular app.\nCache module: Use this devon4ng Angular module when you want to cache requests to server.

Custom themes\nSomethimes prebuild themes do not meet the needs of a project, because color schemas are too specific or do not incorporate branding colors, in those situations custom themes can be built to offer a better solution to the client.\nFor this topic, we are going to use a basic layout project that can be found in devon4ng repository.\nBasics\nBefore starting writing custom themes, there are some necessary things that have to be mentioned:\nAdd a default theme: The project mentioned before has just one global scss stylesheet styles.scss that includes indigo-pink.scss which will be the default theme.\nAdd @import &apos;~@angular/material/theming&apos;; at the begining of the every stylesheet to be able to use angular material prebuilt color palettes and functions.\nAdd @include mat-core(); once per project, so if you are writing multiple themes in multiple files you could import those files from a &apos;central&apos; one (for example styles.scss). This includes all common styles that are used by multiple components.\nFigure 35. Theme files structure.\nBasic custom theme\nTo create a new custom theme, the .scss file containing it has to have imported the angular _theming.scss file (angular/material/theming) file and mat-core included. _theming.scss includes multiple color palettes and some functions that we are going to see below. The file for this basic theme is going to be named styles-custom-dark.scss.\nFirst, declare new variables for primary, accent and warn palettes. Those variables are going to store the result of the function mat-palette.\nmat-palette accepts four arguments: base color palette, main, lighter and darker variants (See [id_palette_variants]) and returns a new palette including some additional map values: default, lighter and darker ([id_scss_map]). Only the first argument is mandatory.\nListing 30. File styles-custom-dark.scss.\n$custom-dark-theme-primary: mat-palette($mat-pink);\n$custom-dark-theme-accent: mat-palette($mat-blue);\n$custom-dark-theme-warn: mat-palette($mat-red);\n);\nIn this example we are using colors available in _theming.scss: mat-pink, mat-blue, mat-red. If you want to use a custom color you need to define a new map, for instance:\nListing 31. File styles-custom-dark.scss custom pink.\n$my-pink: (\n50 : #fcf3f3,\n100 : #f9e0e0,\n200 : #f5cccc,\n300 : #f0b8b8,\n500 : #ea9999,\n900 : #db6b6b,\nA100 : #ffffff,\nA200 : #ffffff,\nA400 : #ffeaea,\nA700 : #ffd0d0,\ncontrast: (\n50 : #000000,\n100 : #000000,\n200 : #000000,\n300 : #000000,\n900 : #000000,\nA100 : #000000,\nA200 : #000000,\nA400 : #000000,\nA700 : #000000,\n)\n);\n$custom-dark-theme-primary: mat-palette($my-pink);\n...\nTip\nSome pages allows to create these palettes easily, for instance: http://mcg.mbitson.com\nUntil now, we just have defined primary, accent and warn palettes but what about foreground and background? Angular material has two functions to change both:\nmat-light-theme: Receives as arguments primary, accent and warn palettes and return a theme whose foreground is basically black (texts, icons, &#x2026;&#x200B;), the background is white and the other palettes are the received ones.\nFigure 36. Custom light theme.\nmat-dark-theme: Similar to mat-light-theme but returns a theme whose foreground is basically white and background black.\nFigure 37. Custom dark theme.\nFor this example we are going to use mat-dark-theme and save its result in $custom-dark-theme.\nListing 32. File styles-custom-dark.scss updated with mat-dark-theme.\n...\n$custom-dark-theme: mat-dark-theme(\n$custom-dark-theme-primary,\n$custom-dark-theme-accent,\n$custom-dark-theme-warn\n);\nTo apply the saved theme, we have to go to styles.scss and import our styles-custom-dark.scss and include a function called angular-material-theme using the theme variable as argument.\nListing 33. File styles.scss.\n...\n@import &apos;styles-custom-dark.scss&apos;;\n@include angular-material-theme($custom-dark-theme);\nIf we have multiple themes it is necessary to add the include statement inside a css class and use it in src/index.html &#x2192; app-root component.\nListing 34. File styles.scss updated with custom-dark-theme class.\n...\n@import &apos;styles-custom-dark.scss&apos;;\n.custom-dark-theme {\n@include angular-material-theme($custom-dark-theme);\n}\nListing 35. File src/index.html.\n...\n&lt;app-root class=&quot;custom-dark-theme&quot;&gt;&lt;/app-root&gt;\n...\nThis will apply $custom-dark-theme theme for the entire application.\nFull custom theme\nSometimes it is needed to custom different elementsw from background and foreground, in those situations we have to create a new function similar to mat-light-theme and mat-dark-theme.

Sample Application\nFigure 38. Basic angular PWA.\nTo explain how to build PWAs using angular, a basic application is going to be built. This app will be able to ask for resources and save in the cache in order to work even offline.\nStep 1: Create a new project and install Angular PWA package\nThis step can be completed with one simple command: ng new &lt;name&gt;, where &lt;names&gt; is the name for the app. In this case, the app is going to be named basic-ng-pwa.\nStep 2: Create a service\nWeb applications usually uses external resources, making necessary the addition of services which can get those resources. This application gets a dish from My Thai Star&#x2019;s back-end and shows it. To do so, a new service is going to be created.\ngo to project folder: cd basic-ng-pwa\nrun ng generate service data\nModify data.service.ts, environment.ts, environment.prod.ts\nTo retrieve data with this service, you have to import the module HttpClient and add it to the service&#x2019;s contructor. Once added, use it to create a function getDishes() that sends http request to My Thai Start&#x2019;s back-end. The URL of the back-end can be stored as an environment variable MY_THAI_STAR_DISH.\ndata.service.ts\n...\nimport { HttpClient } from &apos;@angular/common/http&apos;;\nimport { MY_THAI_STAR_DISH } from &apos;../environments/environment&apos;;\n...\nexport class DataService {\nconstructor(private http: HttpClient) {}\n/* Get data from Back-end */\ngetDishes() {\nreturn this.http.get(MY_THAI_STAR_DISH);\n}\n...\n}\nenvironments.ts\n...\nexport const MY_THAI_STAR_DISH =\n&apos;http://de-mucdevondepl01:8090/api/services/rest/dishmanagement/v1/dish/1&apos;;\n...\nenvironments.prod.ts\n...\nexport const MY_THAI_STAR_DISH =\n&apos;http://de-mucdevondepl01:8090/api/services/rest/dishmanagement/v1/dish/1&apos;;\n...\nStep 3: Use the service\nThe component AppComponent implements the interface OnInit and inside its method ngOnInit() the suscription to the services is done. When a dish arrives, it is saved and shown (app.component.html).\n...\nimport { DataService } from &apos;./data.service&apos;;\nexport class AppComponent implements OnInit {\ndish: { name: string; description: string } = { name: &apos;&apos;, description: &apos;&apos;};\n...\nngOnInit() {\nthis.data\n.getDishes()\n.subscribe(\n(dishToday: { dish: { name: string; description: string } }) =&gt; {\nthis.dish = {\nname: dishToday.dish.name,\ndescription: dishToday.dish.description,\n};\n},\n);\n}\n}\nStep 4: Structures, styles and updates\nThis step shows code interesting inside the sample app. The complete content can be found in devon4ng samples.\nindex.html\nTo use the Montserrat font add the following link inside the tag header.\n&lt;link href=&quot;https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Montserrat&quot; rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot;&gt;\nstyles.scss\nbody {\n...\nfont-family: &apos;Montserrat&apos;, sans-serif;\n}\napp.component.ts\nThis file is also used to reload the app if there are any changes.\nSwUpdate: This object comes inside the @angular/pwa package and it is used to detect changes and reload the page if needed.\n...\nimport { SwUpdate } from &apos;@angular/service-worker&apos;;\nexport class AppComponent implements OnInit {\n...\nconstructor(updates: SwUpdate, private data: DataService) {\nupdates.available.subscribe((event) =&gt; {\nupdates.activateUpdate().then(() =&gt; document.location.reload());\n});\n}\n...\n}\nStep 5: Make it Progressive.\nInstall Angular PWA package with ng add @angular/pwa --project &lt;name&gt;. As before substitute name with basic-ng-pwa.\nThe above command completes the following actions:\nAdds the @angular/service-worker package to your project.\nEnables service worker build support in the CLI.\nImports and registers the service worker in the app module.\nUpdates the index.html file:\nIncludes a link to add the manifest.json file.\nAdds meta tags for theme-color.\nInstalls icon files to support the installed Progressive Web App (PWA).\nCreates the service worker configuration file called ngsw-config.json, which specifies the caching behaviors and other settings.\nmanifest.json\nmanifest.json is a file that allows to control how the app is displayed in places where native apps are displayed.\nFields\nname: Name of the web application.\nshort_name: Short version of name.\ntheme_color: Default theme color for an application context.\nbackground_color: Expected background color of the web application.\ndisplay: Preferred display mode.\nscope: Navigation scope of tghis web application&#x2019;s application context.\nstart_url: URL loaded when the user launches the web application.\nicons: Array of icons that serve as representations of the web app.\nAdditional information can be found here.\nngsw-config.json\nnsgw-config.json specifies which files and data URLs have to be cached and updated by the Angular service worker.\nFields\nindex: File that serves as index page to satisfy navigation requests.\nassetGroups: Resources that are part of the app version that update along with the app.\nname: Identifies the group.\ninstallMode: How the resources are cached (prefetch or lazy).\nupdateMode: Caching behaviour when a new version of the app is found (prefetch or lazy).\nresources: Resources to cache. There are three groups.\nfiles: Lists patterns that match files in the distribution directory.\nurls: URL patterns matched at runtime.\ndataGroups: UsefulIdentifies the group. for API requests.\nname: Identifies the group.\nurls: URL patterns matched at runtime.\nversion: Indicates that the resources being cached have been updated in a backwards-incompatible way.\ncacheConfig: Policy by which matching requests will be cached\nmaxSize: The maximum number of entries, or responses, in the cache.\nmaxAge: How long responses are allowed to remain in the cache.\nd: days. (5d = 5 days).\nh: hours\nm: minutes\ns: seconds. (5m20s = 5 minutes and 20 seconds).\nu: milliseconds\ntimeout: How long the Angular service worker will wait for the network to respond before using a cached response. Same dataformat as maxAge.\nstrategy: Caching strategies (performance or freshness).\nnavigationUrls: List of URLs that will be redirected to the index file.\nAdditional information can be found here.\nStep 6: Configure the app\nmanifest.json\nDefault configuration.\n&#xA0;\n&#xA0;\nngsw-config.json\nAt assetGroups &#x2192; resources &#x2192; urls: In this field the google fonts api is added in order to use Montserrat font even without network.\n&quot;urls&quot;: [\n&quot;https://fonts.googleapis.com/**&quot;\n]\nAt the root of the json: A data group to cache API calls.\n{\n...\n&quot;dataGroups&quot;: [{\n&quot;name&quot;: &quot;mythaistar-dishes&quot;,\n&quot;urls&quot;: [\n&quot;http://de-mucdevondepl01:8090/api/services/rest/dishmanagement/v1/dish/1&quot;\n],\n&quot;cacheConfig&quot;: {\n&quot;maxSize&quot;: 100,\n&quot;maxAge&quot;: &quot;1h&quot;,\n&quot;timeout&quot;: &quot;10s&quot;,\n&quot;strategy&quot;: &quot;freshness&quot;\n}\n}]\n}\nStep 7: Check that your app is a PWA\nTo check if an app is a PWA lets compare its normal behaviour against itself but built for production. Run in the project&#x2019;s root folder the commands below:\nng build --prod to build the app using production settings.\nnpm install http-server to install an npm module that can serve your built application. Documentation here.\nGo to the dist/basic-ng-pwa/ folder running cd dist/basic-ng-pwa.\nhttp-server -o to serve your built app.\nFigure 39. Http server running on localhost:8081.\n&#xA0;\nIn another console instance run ng serve to open the common app (not built).\nFigure 40. Angular server running on localhost:4200.\n&#xA0;\nThe first difference can be found on Developer tools &#x2192; application, here it is seen that the PWA application (left) has a service worker and the common (right) one does not.\nFigure 41. Application service worker comparison.\n&#xA0;\nIf the &quot;offline&quot; box is checked, it will force a disconnection from network. In situations where users do not have connectivity or have a slow, one the PWA can still be accesed and used.\nFigure 42. Offline application.\n&#xA0;\nFinally, browser extensions like Lighthouse can be used to test whether an application is progressive or not.\nFigure 43. Lighthouse report.\n"},{"id":646,"path":"../..\\..\\..\\..\\..\\xampp\\htdocs\\devonfw.github.io\\website\\pages\\docs/master-devon4ng.asciidoc_angular.html#guide-app-initializer.asciidoc","type":"docs","title":"APP_INITIALIZER","body":"18.7.

What is APP_INITIALIZER\nAPP_INITIALIZER allows to provide a service in the initialization of the application in a @NgModule. It also allows to use a factory, allowing to create a singleton in the same service. An example can be found in MyThaiStar /core/config/config.module.ts:\nNote\nThe provider expects the return of a Promise, if it is using Observables, a change with the method toPromise() will allow a switch from Observable to Promise\nimport { NgModule, APP_INITIALIZER } from &apos;@angular/core&apos;;\nimport { HttpClientModule } from &apos;@angular/common/http&apos;;\nimport { ConfigService } from &apos;./config.service&apos;;\n@NgModule({\nimports: [HttpClientModule],\nproviders: [\nConfigService,\n{\nprovide: APP_INITIALIZER,\nuseFactory: ConfigService.factory,\ndeps: [ConfigService],\nmulti: true,\n},\n],\n})\nexport class ConfigModule {}\nThis is going to allow the creation of a ConfigService where, using a singleton, the service is going to load an external config depending on a route. This dependence with a route, allows to setup diferent configuration for docker etc. This is seen in the ConfigService of MyThaiStar:\nimport { Injectable } from &apos;@angular/core&apos;;\nimport { HttpClient } from &apos;@angular/common/http&apos;;\nimport { Config, config } from &apos;./config&apos;;\n@Injectable()\nexport class ConfigService {\nconstructor(private httpClient: HttpClient) {}\nstatic factory(appLoadService: ConfigService) {\nreturn () =&gt; appLoadService.loadExternalConfig();\n}\n// this method gets external configuration calling /config endpoint\n//and merges into config object\nloadExternalConfig(): Promise&lt;any&gt; {\nif (!environment.loadExternalConfig) {\nreturn Promise.resolve({});\n}\nconst promise = this.httpClient\n.get(&apos;/config&apos;)\n.toPromise()\n.then((settings) =&gt; {\nObject.keys(settings || {}).forEach((k) =&gt; {\nconfig[k] = settings[k];\n});\nreturn settings;\n})\n.catch((error) =&gt; {\nreturn &apos;ok, no external configuration&apos;;\n});\nreturn promise;\n}\ngetValues(): Config {\nreturn config;\n}\n}\nAs it is mentioned earlier, you can see the use of a factory to create a singleton at the start. After that, loadExternalConfig is going to look for a boolean inside the corresponding environment file inside the path src/environments/, this boolean loadExternalConfig is going to easily allow to switch to a external config. If it is true, it generates a promise that overwrites the parameters of the local config, allowing to load the external config. Finally, the last method getValues() is going to allow to return the file config with the values (overwritten or not). The local config file from MyThaiStar can be seen here:\nexport enum BackendType {\nIN_MEMORY,\nREST,\nGRAPHQL,\n}\ninterface Role {\nname: string;\npermission: number;\n}\ninterface Lang {\nlabel: string;\nvalue: string;\n}\nexport interface Config {\nversion: string;\nbackendType: BackendType;\nrestPathRoot: string;\nrestServiceRoot: string;\npageSizes: number[];\npageSizesDialog: number[];\nroles: Role[];\nlangs: Lang[];\n}\nexport const config: Config = {\nversion: &apos;dev&apos;,\nbackendType: BackendType.REST,\nrestPathRoot: &apos;http://localhost:8081/mythaistar/&apos;,\nrestServiceRoot: &apos;http://localhost:8081/mythaistar/services/rest/&apos;,\npageSizes: [8, 16, 24],\npageSizesDialog: [4, 8, 12],\nroles: [\n{ name: &apos;CUSTOMER&apos;, permission: 0 },\n{ name: &apos;WAITER&apos;, permission: 1 },\n],\nlangs: [\n{ label: &apos;English&apos;, value: &apos;en&apos; },\n{ label: &apos;Deutsch&apos;, value: &apos;de&apos; },\n{ label: &apos;Espa&#xF1;ol&apos;, value: &apos;es&apos; },\n{ label: &apos;Catal&#xE0;&apos;, value: &apos;ca&apos; },\n{ label: &apos;Fran&#xE7;ais&apos;, value: &apos;fr&apos; },\n{ label: &apos;Nederlands&apos;, value: &apos;nl&apos; },\n{ label: &apos;&#x939;&#x93F;&#x928;&#x94D;&#x926;&#x940;&apos;, value: &apos;hi&apos; },\n{ label: &apos;Polski&apos;, value: &apos;pl&apos; },\n{ label: &apos;&#x420;&#x443;&#x441;&#x441;&#x43A;&#x438;&#x439;&apos;, value: &apos;ru&apos; },\n{ label: &apos;&#x431;&#x44A;&#x43B;&#x433;&#x430;&#x440;&#x441;&#x43A;&#x438;&apos;, value: &apos;bg&apos; },\n],\n};\nFinally, inside a environment file src/environments/environment.ts the use of the boolean loadExternalConfig is seen:\n// The file contents for the current environment will overwrite these during build.\n// The build system defaults to the dev environment which uses `environment.ts`, but if you do\n// `ng build --env=prod` then `environment.prod.ts` will be used instead.\n// The list of which env maps to which file can be found in `.angular-cli.json`.\nexport const environment: {\nproduction: boolean;\nloadExternalConfig: boolean;\n} = { production: false, loadExternalConfig: false };\n"},{"id":649,"path":"../..\\..\\..\\..\\..\\xampp\\htdocs\\devonfw.github.io\\website\\pages\\docs/master-devon4ng.asciidoc_angular.html#guide-app-initializer.asciidoc_creating-a-app_initializer-configuration","type":"docs","title":"Creating a APP_INITIALIZER configuration","body":"18.7.3.

Else, it is going to load the external config in the path (/config), and overwrite the values from the external config to the config thats going to be used by the app, this is all returned in a promise.\n3.- Create in the core a module for the config app/core/config/ a config.module.ts:\nimport { NgModule, APP_INITIALIZER } from &apos;@angular/core&apos;;\nimport { HttpClientModule } from &apos;@angular/common/http&apos;;\nimport { ConfigService } from &apos;./config.service&apos;;\n@NgModule({\nimports: [HttpClientModule],\nproviders: [\nConfigService,\n{\nprovide: APP_INITIALIZER,\nuseFactory: ConfigService.factory,\ndeps: [ConfigService],\nmulti: true,\n},\n],\n})\nexport class ConfigModule {}\nAs seen earlier, the ConfigService is added to the module. In this addition, the app is initialized(provide) and it uses the factory that was created in the ConfigService loading the config with or without the external values depending on the boolean in the config.\nUsing the Config Service\nAs a first step, in the file /app/app.module.ts the ConfigModule created earlier in the other step is going to be imported:\nimports: [\n....\nConfigModule,\n....\n]\nAfter that, the ConfigService is going to be injected into the app.component.ts\n....\nimport { ConfigService } from &apos;./core/config/config.service&apos;;\n....\nexport class AppComponent {\n....\nconstructor(public configService: ConfigService) { }\n....\nFinally, for this demonstration app, the component app/app.component.html is going to show the version of the config it is using at that moment.\n&lt;div style=&quot;text-align:center&quot;&gt;\n&lt;h1&gt;\nWelcome to {{ title }}!\n&lt;/h1&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Here is the configuration version that is using angular right now: {{configService.getValues().version}}&lt;/h2&gt;\nFinal steps\nThe script start that was created earlier in the package.json (npm start) is going to be used to start the application. After that, modifying the boolean loadExternalConfig inside the corresponding environment file inside /app/environments/ should show the different config versions.\n"},{"id":654,"path":"../..\\..\\..\\..\\..\\xampp\\htdocs\\devonfw.github.io\\website\\pages\\docs/master-devon4ng.asciidoc_angular.html#guide-component-decomposition.asciidoc","type":"docs","title":"Component Decomposition","body":"18.8.

Defining state\nEvery UI has state.\nThere are different kinds of state, for example\nView State: e.g. is a panel open, a css transition pending, etc.\nApplication State: e.g. is a payment pending, current URL, user info, etc.\nBusiness Data: e.g. products loaded from backend\nIt is good practice to base the component decomposition on the state handled by a component and to define a simplified state model beforehand.\nStarting with the parent - the Smart Component:\nWhat overall state does the dialog have: e.g. loading, error, valid data loaded, valid input, invalid input, etc.\nEvery defined value should correspond to an overall appearance of the whole dialog.\nWhat events can occur to the dialog: e.g. submitting a form, changing a filter, pressing buttons, pressing keys, etc.\nFor every Dumb Component:\nWhat data does a component display: e.g. a header text, user information to be displayed, a loading flag, etc.\nThis will be a slice of the overall state of the parent Smart Component.\nIn general a Dumb Component presents a slice of its parent Smart Components state to the user.\nWhat events can occur: keyboard events, mouse events, etc.\nThese events are all handled by its parent Smart Component - every event is passed up the tree to be handled by a Smart Component.\nThese information should be reflected inside the modeled state.\nThe implementation is a TypeScript type - an interface or a class describing the model.\nSo there should be a type describing all state relevant for a Smart Component.\nAn instance of that type is send down the component tree at runtime.\nNot every Dumb Component will need the whole state.\nFor instance a single Dumb Component could only need a single string.\nThe state model for the previous Listpicker example is shown in the following listing.\nListing 42. Listpicker state model\nexport class ListpickerState {\nitems: {}[]|undefined;\ncolumns = [&apos;key&apos;, &apos;value&apos;];\nkeyColumn = &apos;key&apos;;\ndisplayValueColumn = &apos;value&apos;;\nfilteredItems: {}[]|undefined;\nfilter = &apos;&apos;;\nplaceholder = &apos;&apos;;\ncaseSensitive = true;\nisDisabled = false;\nisDropdownOpen = false;\nselectedItem: {}|undefined;\ndisplayValue = &apos;&apos;;\n}\nListpicker holds an instance of ListpickerState which is passed down the component tree via @Input() bindings in the Dumb Components.\nEvents emitted by children - Dumb Components - create a new instance of ListpickerState based on the current instance and the event and its data.\nSo a state transition is just setting a new instance of ListpickerState.\nAngular Bindings propagate the value down the tree after exchanging the state.\nListing 43. Listpicker State transition\nexport class ListpickerComponent {\n// initial default values are set\nstate = new ListpickerState();\n/** User changes filter */\nonFilterChange(filter: string): void {\n// apply filter ...\nconst filteredList = this.filterService.filter(...);\n// important: A new instance is created, instead of altering the existing one.\n// This makes change detection easier and prevents hard to find bugs.\nthis.state = Object.assing({}, this.state, {\nfilteredItems: filteredList,\nfilter: filter\n});\n}\n}\nNote:\nIt is not always necessary to define the model as independent type.\nSo there would be no state property and just properties for every state defined directly in the component class.\nWhen complexity grows and state becomes larger this is usually a good idea.\nIf the state should be shared between Smart Components a store is to be used.\n"},{"id":657,"path":"../..\\..\\..\\..\\..\\xampp\\htdocs\\devonfw.github.io\\website\\pages\\docs/master-devon4ng.asciidoc_angular.html#guide-component-decomposition.asciidoc_when-are-dumb-components-needed","type":"docs","title":"When are Dumb Components needed","body":"18.8.3.

Adapters handle backend communication\nAs illustrated in the figure a Use Case service does not use Angular HttpClient directly but uses an adapter.\nA basic adapter could look like this:\nListing 44. Example adapter\nimport { Injectable } from &apos;@angular/core&apos;;\nimport { HttpClient } from &apos;@angular/common/http&apos;;\nimport { Observable } from &apos;rxjs/Observable&apos;;\nimport { FlightTo } from &apos;./flight-to&apos;;\n@Injectable({\nprovidedIn: &apos;root&apos;,\n})\nexport class FlightsAdapter {\nconstructor(\nprivate httpClient: HttpClient\n) {}\ngetFlights(): Observable&lt;FlightTo&gt; {\nreturn this.httpClient.get&lt;FlightTo&gt;(&apos;/relative/url/to/flights&apos;);\n}\n}\nThe adapters should use a well-defined transfer data model.\nThis could be generated from server endpoints with CobiGen, Swagger, typescript-maven-plugin, etc.\nIf inside the application there is a business model defined, the adapter has to parse to the transfer model.\nThis is illustrated in the following listing.\nListing 45.

Token management\nIn most cases the access to backend API is secured using well konwn mechanisms as CSRF, JWT or both. In these cases the frontend application must manage the tokens that are generated when the user authenticates. More concretely it must store them to include them in every request automatically. Obviously, when user logs out these tokens must be removed from localStorage, memory, etc.\nStore security token\nIn order to make this guide simple we are going to store the token in memory. Therefore, if we consider that we already have a login mechanism implemented we would like to store the token using a auth.service.ts:\nimport { Injectable } from &apos;@angular/core&apos;;\nimport { Router } from &apos;@angular/router&apos;;\n@Injectable({\nprovidedIn: &apos;root&apos;,\n})\nexport class AuthService {\nprivate loggedIn = false;\nprivate token: string;\nconstructor(public router: Router) {}\npublic isLogged(): boolean {\nreturn this.loggedIn || false;\n}\npublic setLogged(login: boolean): void {\nthis.loggedIn = login;\n}\npublic getToken(): string {\nreturn this.token;\n}\npublic setToken(token: string): void {\nthis.token = token;\n}\n}\nUsing the previous service we will be able to store the token obtained in the login request using the method setToken(token). Please consider that, if you want a more sofisticated approach using localStorage API, you will need to modify this service accordingly.\nInclude token in every request\nNow that the token is available in the application it is necessary to include it in every request to a protected API endpoint. Instead of modifying all the http requests in our application, Angular provides a class to intercept every request (and every response if we need to) called HttpInterceptor. Let&#x2019;s create a service called http-interceptor.service.ts to implement the intercept method of this class:\nimport {\nHttpEvent,\nHttpHandler,\nHttpInterceptor,\nHttpRequest,\n} from &apos;@angular/common/http&apos;;\nimport { Injectable } from &apos;@angular/core&apos;;\nimport { Observable } from &apos;rxjs&apos;;\nimport { environment } from &apos;../../../environments/environment&apos;;\nimport { AuthService } from &apos;./auth.service&apos;;\n@Injectable()\nexport class HttpRequestInterceptorService implements HttpInterceptor {\nconstructor(private auth: AuthService) {}\nintercept(\nreq: HttpRequest&lt;any&gt;,\nnext: HttpHandler,\n): Observable&lt;HttpEvent&lt;any&gt;&gt; {\n// Get the auth header from the service.\nconst authHeader: string = this.auth.getToken();\nif (authHeader) {\nlet authReq: HttpRequest&lt;any&gt;;\n// CSRF\nif (environment.security === &apos;csrf&apos;) {\nauthReq = req.clone({\nwithCredentials: true,\nsetHeaders: { &apos;x-csrf-token&apos;: authHeader },\n});\n}\n// JWT\nif (environment.security === &apos;jwt&apos;) {\nauthReq = req.clone({\nsetHeaders: { Authorization: authHeader },\n});\n}\nreturn next.handle(authReq);\n} else {\nreturn next.handle(req);\n}\n}\n}\nAs you may notice, this service is making use of an environment field environment.security to determine if we are using JWT or CSRF in order to inject the token accordingly. In your application you can combine both if necessary.\nConfigure environment.ts file to use the CSRF/JWT.\nsecurity: &apos;csrf&apos;\nThe authHeader used is obtained using the injected service AuthService already presented above.\nIn order to activate the interceptor we need to provide it in our app.module.ts or core.module.ts depending on the application structure. Let&#x2019;s assume that we are using the latter and the interceptor file is inside a security folder:\n...\nimport { HttpRequestInterceptorService } from &apos;./security/http-request-interceptor.service&apos;;\n...\n@NgModule({\nimports: [...],\nexports: [...],\ndeclarations: [],\nproviders: [\n...\n{\nprovide: HTTP_INTERCEPTORS,\nuseClass: HttpRequestInterceptorService,\nmulti: true,\n},\n],\n})\nexport class CoreModule {}\nAngular automatically will now modify every request and include in the header the token if it is convenient.\n"},{"id":661,"path":"../..\\..\\..\\..\\..\\xampp\\htdocs\\devonfw.github.io\\website\\pages\\docs/master-devon4ng.asciidoc_angular.html#guide-error-handler.asciidoc","type":"docs","title":"Error Handler in angular","body":"18.10.

Creating your custom ErrorHandler step by step\nIn order to create a custom ErrorHandler three steps are going to be needed:\nCreating the custom ErrorHandler class\nIn this first step the custom ErrorHandler class is going to be created inside the folder /app/core/errors/errors-handler.ts:\nimport { ErrorHandler, Injectable, Injector } from &apos;@angular/core&apos;;\nimport { HttpErrorResponse } from &apos;@angular/common/http&apos;;\n@Injectable()\nexport class ErrorsHandler implements ErrorHandler {\nconstructor(private injector: Injector) {}\nhandleError(error: Error | HttpErrorResponse) {\n// To do: Use injector to get the necessary services to redirect or\n// show a message to the user\nconst classname = error.constructor.name;\nswitch ( classname ) {\ncase &apos;HttpErrorResponse&apos;:\nconsole.error(&apos;HttpError:&apos; + error.message);\nif (!navigator.onLine) {\nconsole.error(&apos;Theres no internet connection&apos;);\n// To do: control here in internet what you wanna do if user has no internet\n} else {\nconsole.error(&apos;Server Error:&apos; + error.message);\n// To do: control here if the server gave an error\n}\nbreak;\ndefault:\nconsole.error(&apos;Error:&apos; + error.message);\n// To do: control here if the client/other things gave an error\n}\n}\n}\nThis class can be used to control the different type of errors. If wanted, the classname variable could be used to add more switch cases. This would allow control of more specific situations.\nCreating a ErrorInterceptor\nInside the same folder created in the last step we are going to create the ErrorInterceptor(errors-handler-interceptor.ts). This ErrorInterceptor is going to retry any failed calls to the server to make sure it is not being found before showing the error:\nimport { HttpInterceptor, HttpRequest, HttpHandler, HttpEvent } from &apos;@angular/common/http&apos;;\nimport { Injectable } from &apos;@angular/core&apos;;\nimport { Observable } from &apos;rxjs&apos;;\nimport { retry } from &apos;rxjs/operators&apos;;\n@Injectable()\nexport class ErrorsHandlerInterceptor implements HttpInterceptor {\nconstructor() {}\nintercept(req: HttpRequest&lt;any&gt;, next: HttpHandler): Observable&lt;HttpEvent&lt;any&gt;&gt; {\nreturn next.handle(req).pipe(\nretryWhen((errors: Observable&lt;any&gt;) =&gt; errors.pipe(\ndelay(500),\ntake(5),\nconcatMap((error: any, retryIndex: number) =&gt; {\nif (++retryIndex === 5) {\nthrow error;\n}\nreturn of(error);\n})\n))\n);\n}\n}\nThis custom made interceptor is implementing the HttpInterceptor and inside the method intercept using the method pipe,retryWhen,delay,take and concatMap from RxJs it is going to do the next things if there is errors:\nWith delay(500) do a delay to allow some time in between requests\nWith take(5) retry five times.\nWith concatMap if the index that take() gives is not 5 it returns the error, else, it throws the error.\nCreating a Error Module\nFinally, creating a module(errors-handler.module.ts) is necessary to include the interceptor and the custom error handler. In this case, the module is going to be created in the same folder as the last two:\nimport { NgModule, ErrorHandler } from &apos;@angular/core&apos;;\nimport { CommonModule } from &apos;@angular/common&apos;;\nimport { ErrorsHandler } from &apos;./errors-handler&apos;;\nimport { HTTP_INTERCEPTORS } from &apos;@angular/common/http&apos;;\nimport { ErrorsHandlerInterceptor } from &apos;./errors-handler-interceptor&apos;;\n@NgModule({\ndeclarations: [], // Declare here component if you want to use routing to error component\nimports: [\nCommonModule\n],\nproviders: [\n{\nprovide: ErrorHandler,\nuseClass: ErrorsHandler,\n},\n{\nprovide: HTTP_INTERCEPTORS,\nuseClass: ErrorsHandlerInterceptor,\nmulti: true,\n}\n]\n})\nexport class ErrorsHandlerModule { }\nThis module simply is providing the services that are implemented by our custom classes and then telling angular to use our custom made classes instead of the default ones. After doing this, the module has to be included in the app module app.module.ts in order to be used.\n....\nimports: [\nErrorsHandlerModule,\n....\n"},{"id":664,"path":"../..\\..\\..\\..\\..\\xampp\\htdocs\\devonfw.github.io\\website\\pages\\docs/master-devon4ng.asciidoc_angular.html#guide-error-handler.asciidoc_handling-errors","type":"docs","title":"Handling Errors","body":"18.10.3.

In order to use this service properly, NgZone is necessary. The method run() from NgZone will allow the service to be inside the Angular Zone. An example on how to use it:\nimport { ErrorHandler, Injectable, Injector, NgZone } from &apos;@angular/core&apos;;\nimport { HttpErrorResponse } from &apos;@angular/common/http&apos;;\nimport { MatSnackBar } from &apos;@angular/material&apos;;\n@Injectable()\nexport class ErrorsHandler implements ErrorHandler {\nconstructor(private injector: Injector, private zone: NgZone) {}\nhandleError(error: Error | HttpErrorResponse) {\n// Use injector to get the necessary services to redirect or\nconst snackBar: MatSnackBar = this.injector.get(MatSnackBar);\nconst classname = error.constructor.name;\nlet message: string;\nswitch ( classname ) {\ncase &apos;HttpErrorResponse&apos;:\nmessage = !(navigator.onLine) ? &apos;There is no internet connection&apos; : error.message;\nbreak;\ndefault:\nmessage = error.message;\n}\nthis.zone.run(\n() =&gt; snackBar.open(message, &apos;danger&apos;, { duration : 4000})\n);\n}\n}\nUsing Injector the MatSnackBar is obtained, then the correct message is obtained inside the switch.

This way the structure of a view becomes very readable.\nAs mentioned before, if a Dumb Component is used by multiple Smart Components inside the components layer\nit is put inside the /shared folder inside the components layer.\nWith this way of thinking the shared module makes a lot of sense. If a Dumb Component is used by multiple Smart Components\nfrom different feature modules, the Dumb Component is placed into the shared module.\nListing 50.

The HttpLoader is a class that implements the TranslocoLoader interface. It&#x2019;s responsible for instructing Transloco how to load the translation files. It uses Angular HTTP client to fetch the files, based on the given path.\nUsage\nIn order to translate any label in any HTML template you will need to use the transloco pipe available:\n{{ &apos;HELLO&apos; | transloco }}\nAn optional parameter from the component TypeScript class could be included as follows:\n{{ &apos;HELLO&apos; | transloco: { value: dynamic } }}\nIt is possible to use with inputs:\n&lt;span [attr.alt]=&quot;&apos;hello&apos; | transloco&quot;&gt;Attribute&lt;/span&gt;\n&lt;span [title]=&quot;&apos;hello&apos; | transloco&quot;&gt;Property&lt;/span&gt;\nIn order to change the language used you will need to create a button or selector that calls the this.translocoService.use(language: string) method from TranslocoService. For example:\nexport class AppComponent {\nconstructor(private translocoService: TranslocoService) {}\nchangeLanguage(lang) {\nthis.translocoService.setActiveLang(lang);\n}\n}\nThe translations will be included in the en.json, es.json, de.json, etc. files inside the /assets/i18n folder. For example en.json would be (using the previous param):\n{\n&quot;HELLO&quot;: &quot;hello&quot;\n}\nOr with an optional param:\n{\n&quot;HELLO&quot;: &quot;hello {{value}}&quot;\n}\nTransloco understands nested JSON objects. This means that you can have a translation that looks like this:\n{\n&quot;HOME&quot;: {\n&quot;HELLO&quot;: &quot;hello {{value}}&quot;\n}\n}\nIn order to access access the value, use the dot notation, in this case HOME.HELLO.\nUsing the service, pipe or directive\nStructural Directive\nUsing a structural directive is the recommended approach. It&#x2019;s DRY and efficient, as it creates one subscription per template:\n&lt;ng-container *transloco=&quot;let t&quot;&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;{{ t(&apos;title&apos;) }}&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;comp [title]=&quot;t(&apos;title&apos;)&quot;&gt;&lt;/comp&gt;\n&lt;/ng-container&gt;\nNote that the t function is memoized. It means that given the same key it will return the result directly from the cache.\nWe can pass a params object as the second parameter:\n&lt;ng-container *transloco=&quot;let t&quot;&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;{{ t(&apos;name&apos;, { name: &apos;Transloco&apos; }) }}&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/ng-container&gt;\nWe can instruct the directive to use a different language in our template:\n&lt;ng-container *transloco=&quot;let t; lang: &apos;es&apos;&quot;&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;{{ t(&apos;title&apos;) }}&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/ng-container&gt;\nPipe\nThe use of pipes can be possible too:\ntemplate:\n&lt;div&gt;{{ &apos;HELLO&apos; | transloco:param }}&lt;/div&gt;\ncomponent:\nparam = {value: &apos;world&apos;};\nAttribute Directive\nThe last option available with transloco is the attribute directive:\n&lt;div transloco=&quot;HELLO&quot; [translocoParams]=&quot;{ value: &apos;world&apos; }&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\nService\nIf you need to access translations in any component or service you can do it injecting the TranslocoService into them:\n// Sync translation\ntranslocoService.translate(&apos;HELLO&apos;, {value: &apos;world&apos;});\n// Async translation\ntranslocoService.selectTranslate(&apos;HELLO&apos;, { value: &apos;world&apos; }).subscribe(res =&gt; {\nconsole.log(res);\n//=&gt; &apos;hello world&apos;\n});\nImportant\nYou can find a complete example at https://github.com/devonfw/devon4ng-application-template.\nPlease, visit https://netbasal.gitbook.io/transloco for more info.\n"},{"id":671,"path":"../..\\..\\..\\..\\..\\xampp\\htdocs\\devonfw.github.io\\website\\pages\\docs/master-devon4ng.asciidoc_angular.html#guide-routing.asciidoc","type":"docs","title":"Routing","body":"18.13.

Guards\nGuards are Angular services implemented on routes which determines whether a user can naviagate to/from the route. There are examples below which will explain things better. We have the following types of Guards:\nCanActivate: It is used to determine whether a user can visit a route. The most common scenario for this guard is to check if the user is authenticated. For example, if we want only logged in users to be able to go to a particular route, we will implement the CanActivate guard on this route.\nCanActivateChild: Same as above, only implemented on child routes.\nCanDeactivate: It is used to determine if a user can naviagate away from a route. Most common example is when a user tries to go to a different page after filling up a form and does not save/submit the changes, we can use this guard to confirm whether the user really wants to leave the page without saving/submiting.\nResolve: For resolving dynamic data.\nCanLoad: It is used to determine whether an Angular module can be loaded lazily. Example below will be helpful to understand it.\nLet&#x2019;s have a look at some examples.\nExample 1 - CanActivate and CanActivateChild guards\nCanActivate guard\nAs mentioned earlier, a guard is an Angular service and services are simply TypeScript classes. So we begin by creating a class. This class has to implement the CanActivate interface (imported from angular/router), and therefore, must have a canActivate function. The logic of this function determines whether the requested route can be navigated to or not. It returns either a boolean value or an Observable or a Promise which resolves to a boolean value. If it is true, the route is loaded, else not.\nListing 55. CanActivate example\n...\nimport {CanActivate} from &quot;@angular/router&quot;;\n@Injectable()\nclass ExampleAuthGuard implements CanActivate {\nconstructor(private authService: AuthService) {}\ncanActivate(route: ActivatedRouterSnapshot, state: RouterStateSnapshot) {\nif (this.authService.isLoggedIn()) {\nreturn true;\n} else {\nwindow.alert(&apos;Please log in first&apos;);\nreturn false;\n}\n}\n}\nIn the above example, let&#x2019;s assume we have a AuthService which has a isLoggedIn() method which returns a boolean value depending on whether the user is logged in. We use it to return true or false from the canActivate function.\nThe canActivate function accepts two parameters (provided by Angular). The first parameter of type ActivatedRouterSnapshot is the snapshot of the route the user is trying to naviagate to (where the guard is implemented); we can extract the route parameters from this instance. The second parameter of type RouterStateSnapshot is a snapshot of the router state the user is trying to naviagate to; we can fetch the URL from it&#x2019;s url property.\nTip\nWe can also redirect the user to another page (maybe a login page) if the authService returns false. To do that, inject Router and use it&#x2019;s naviagate function to redirect to the appropriate page.\nSince it is a service, it needs to be provided in our module:\nListing 56. provide the guard in a module\n@NgModule({\n...\nproviders: [\n...\nExampleAuthGuard\n]\n})\nNow this guard is ready to use on our routes. We implement it where we define our array of routes in the application:\nListing 57. Implementing the guard\n...\nconst routes: Routes = [\n{ path: &apos;&apos;, redirectTo: &apos;home&apos;, pathMatch: &apos;full&apos; },\n{ path: &apos;home&apos;, component: HomeComponent },\n{ path: &apos;page1&apos;, component: Page1Component, canActivate: [ExampleAuthGuard] }\n];\nAs you can see, the canActivate property accepts an array of guards. So we can implement more than one guard on a route.\nCanActivateChild guard\nTo use the guard on nested (children) routes, we add it to the canActivateChild property like so:\nListing 58. Implementing the guard on child routes\n...\nconst routes: Routes = [\n{ path: &apos;&apos;, redirectTo: &apos;home&apos;, pathMatch: &apos;full&apos; },\n{ path: &apos;home&apos;, component: HomeComponent },\n{ path: &apos;page1&apos;, component: Page1Component, canActivateChild: [ExampleAuthGuard], children: [\n{path: &apos;sub-page1&apos;, component: SubPageComponent},\n{path: &apos;sub-page2&apos;, component: SubPageComponent}\n] }\n];\nExample 2 - CanLoad guard\nSimilar to CanActivate, to use this guard we implement the CanLoad interface and overwrite it&#x2019;s canLoad function. Again, this function returns either a boolean value or an Observable or a Promise which resolves to a boolean value. The fundamental difference between CanActivate and CanLoad is that CanLoad is used to determine whether an entire module can be lazily loaded or not. If the guard returns false for a module protected by CanLoad, the entire module is not loaded.\nListing 59. CanLoad example\n...\nimport {CanLoad, Route} from &quot;@angular/router&quot;;\n@Injectable()\nclass ExampleCanLoadGuard implements CanLoad {\nconstructor(private authService: AuthService) {}\ncanLoad(route: Route) {\nif (this.authService.isLoggedIn()) {\nreturn true;\n} else {\nwindow.alert(&apos;Please log in first&apos;);\nreturn false;\n}\n}\n}\nAgain, let&#x2019;s assume we have a AuthService which has a isLoggedIn() method which returns a boolean value depending on whether the user is logged in. The canLoad function accepts a parameter of type Route which we can use to fetch the path a user is trying to navigate to (using the path property of Route).\nThis guard needs to be provided in our module like any other service.\nTo implement the guard, we use the canLoad property:\nListing 60. Implementing the guard\n...\nconst routes: Routes = [\n{ path: &apos;home&apos;, component: HomeComponent },\n{ path: &apos;admin&apos;, loadChildren: &apos;app/admin/admin.module#AdminModule&apos;, canLoad: [ExampleCanLoadGuard] }\n];\n"},{"id":675,"path":"../..\\..\\..\\..\\..\\xampp\\htdocs\\devonfw.github.io\\website\\pages\\docs/master-devon4ng.asciidoc_angular.html#guide-testing.asciidoc","type":"docs","title":"Testing","body":"18.14.

The primary reason is the naming collision with the Web Components standard (see Web Components).\nTo clarify this:\nA component describes an UI element containing HTML, CSS and JavaScript - structure, design and logic encapsulated inside a reusable container called component.\nA module describes an applications feature area. The application flight-app may have a module called booking.\nAn application developed using Angular consists of multiple modules.\nThere are feature modules and special modules described by the Angular Styleguide - core and shared.\nAngular or Angular Styleguide give no guidance on how to structure a module internally.\nThis is where this architecture comes in.\nLayers\nThe architecture describes two layers.

Introduction\nPurpose of this document\nIn our business applications, the client easily gets underestimated. Sometimes the client is more complex to develop and design than the server. While the server architecture is nowadays easily to agree as common sense, for clients this is not as obvious and stable especially as it typically depends on the client framework used. Finding a concrete architecture applicable for all clients may therefore be difficult to accomplish.\nThis document tries to define on a high abstract level, a reference architecture which is supposed to be a mental image and frame for orientation regarding the evaluation and appliance of different client frameworks. As such it defines terms and concepts required to be provided for in any framework and thus gives a common ground of understanding for those acquainted with the reference architecture. This allows better comparison between the various frameworks out there, each having their own terms for essentially the same concepts. It also means that for each framework we need to explicitly map how it implements the concepts defined in this document.\nThe architecture proposed herein is neither new nor was it developed from scratch. Instead it is the gathered and consolidated knowledge and best practices of various projects (s. References).\nGoal of the Client Architecture\nThe goal of the client architecture is to support the non-functional requirements for the client, i.e. mostly maintainability, scalability, efficiency and portability. As such it provides a component-oriented architecture following the same principles listed already in the devonfw architecture overview. Furthermore it ensures a homogeneity regarding how different concrete UI technologies are being applied in the projects, solving the common requirements in the same way.\nArchitecture Views\nAs for the server we distinguish between the business and the technical architecture. Where the business architecture is different from project to project and relates to the concrete design of dialog components given concrete requirements, the technical architecture can be applied to multiple projects.\nThe focus of this document is to provide a technical reference architecture on the client on a very abstract level defining required layers and components. How the architecture is implemented has to be defined for each UI technology.\nThe technical infrastructure architecture is out of scope for this document and although it needs to be considered, the concepts of the reference architecture should work across multiple TI architecture, i.e. native or web clients.\n"},{"id":697,"path":"../..\\..\\..\\..\\..\\xampp\\htdocs\\devonfw.github.io\\website\\pages\\docs/master-devon4ng.asciidoc_architecture.html#meta-architecture.asciidoc_devonfw-reference-client-architecture","type":"docs","title":"devonfw Reference Client Architecture","body":"15.2.2. devonfw Reference Client Architecture\nThe following gives a complete overview of the proposed reference architecture. It will be built up incrementally in the following sections.\nFigure 1 Overview\nClient Architecture\nOn the highest level of abstraction we see the need to differentiate between dialog components and their container they are managed in, as well as the access to the application server being the backend for the client (e.g. an devon4j instance). This section gives a summary of these components and how they relate to each other. Detailed architectures for each component will be supplied in subsequent sections\nFigure 2 Overview of Client Architecture\nDialog Component\nA dialog component is a logical, self-contained part of the user interface. It accepts user input and actions and controls communication with the user. Dialog components use the services provided by the dialog container in order to execute the business logic. They are self-contained, i.e. they possess their own user interface together with the associated logic, data and states.\nDialog components can be composed of other dialog components forming a hierarchy\nDialog components can interact with each other. This includes communication of a parent to its children, but also between components independent of each other regarding the hierarchy.\nDialog Container\nDialog components need to be managed in their lifecycle and how they can be coupled to each other. The dialog container is responsible for this along with the following:\nBootstrapping the client application and environment\nConfiguration of the client\nInitialization of the application server access component\nDialog Component Management\nControlling the lifecycle\nControlling the dialog flow\nProviding means of interaction between the dialogs\nProviding application server access\nProviding services to the dialog components\n(e.g. printing, caching, data storage)\nShutdown of the application\nApplication Server Access\nDialogs will require a backend application server in order to execute their business logic. Typically in an devonfw application the service layer will provide interfaces for the functionality exposed to the client. These business oriented interfaces should also be present on the client backed by a proxy handling the concrete call of the server over the network. This component provides the set of interfaces as well as the proxy.\nDialog Container Architecture\nThe dialog container can be further structured into the following components with their respective tasks described in own sections:\nFigure 3 Dialog Container Architecture\nApplication\nThe application component represents the overall client in our architecture. It is responsible for bootstrapping all other components and connecting them with each other. As such it initializes the components below and provides an environment for them to work in.\nConfiguration Management\nThe configuration management manages the configuration of the client, so the client can be deployed in different environments. This includes configuration of the concrete application server to be called or any other environment-specific property.\nDialog Management\nThe Dialog Management component provides the means to define, create and destroy dialog components. It therefore offers basic lifecycle capabilities for a component. In addition it also allows composition of dialog components in a hierarchy. The lifecycle is then managed along the hierarchy, meaning when creating/destroying a parent dialog, this affects all child components, which are created/destroyed as well.\nService Registry\nApart from dialog components, a client application also consists of services offered to these. A service can thereby encompass among others:\nAccess to the application server\nAccess to the dialog container functions for managing dialogs or accessing the configuration\nDialog independent client functionality such as Printing, Caching, Logging, Encapsulated business logic such as tax calculation\nDialog component interaction\nThe service registry offers the possibility to define, register and lookup these services. Note that these services could be dependent on the dialog hierarchy, meaning different child instances could obtain different instances / implementations of a service via the service registry, depending on which service implementations are registered by the parents.\nServices should be defined as interfaces allowing for different implementations and thus loose coupling.\nDialog Component Architecture\nA dialog component has to support all or a subset of the following tasks:\n(T1)\tDisplaying the user interface incl. internationalization\n(T2)\tDisplaying business data incl. changes made to the data due to user interactions and localization of the data\n(T3)\tAccepting user input including possible conversion from e.g. entered Text to an Integer\n(T4)\tDisplaying the dialog state\n(T5)\tValidation of user input\n(T6)\tManaging the business data incl. business logic altering it due to user interactions\n(T7)\tExecution of user interactions\n(T8)\tManaging the state of the dialog (e.g. Edit vs. View)\n(T9)\tCalling the application server in the course of user interactions\nFollowing the principle of separation of concerns, we further structure a dialog component in an own architecture allowing us the distribute responsibility for these tasks along the defined components:\nFigure 4 Overview of dialog component architecture\nPresentation Layer\nThe presentation layer generates and displays the user interface, accepts user input and user actions and binds these to the dialog core layer (T1-5). The tasks of the presentation layer fall into two categories:\nProvision of the visual representation (View component)\nThe presentation layer generates and displays the user interface and accepts user input and user actions. The logical processing of the data, actions and states is performed in the dialog core layer. The data and user interface are displayed in localized and internationalized form.\nBinding of the visual representation to the dialog core layer\nThe presentation layer itself does not contain any dialog logic. The data or actions entered by the user are then processed in the dialog core layer. There are three aspects to the binding to the dialog core layer. We refer to &#x201C;data binding&#x201D;, &#x201C;state binding&#x201D; and &#x201C;action binding&#x201D;. Syntactical and (to a certain extent) semantic validations are performed during data binding (e.g. cross-field plausibility checks). Furthermore, the formatted, localized data in the presentation layer is converted into the presentation-independent, neutral data in the dialog core layer (parsing) and vice versa (formatting).\nDialog Core Layer\nThe dialog core layer contains the business logic, the control logic, and the logical state of the dialog. It therefore covers tasks T5-9:\nMaintenance of the logical dialog state and the logical data\nThe dialog core layer maintains the logical dialog state and the logical data in a form which is independent of the presentation. The states of the presentation (e.g. individual widgets) must not be maintained in the dialog core layer, e.g. the view state could lead to multiple presentation states disabling all editable widgets on the view.\nImplementation of the dialog and dialog control logic\nThe component parts in the dialog core layer implement the client specific business logic and the dialog control logic. This includes, for example, the manipulation of dialog data and dialog states as well as the opening and closing of dialogs.\nCommunication with the application server\nThe dialog core layer calls the interfaces of the application server via the application server access component services.\nThe dialog core layer should not depend on the presentation layer enforcing a strict layering and thus minimizing dependencies.\nInteractions between dialog components\nDialog components can interact in the following ways:\nEmbedding of dialog components\nAs already said dialog components can be hierarchically composed. This composition works by embedding on dialog component within the other. Apart from the lifecycle managed by the dialog container, the embedding needs to cope for the visual embedding of the presentation and core layer.\nEmbedding dialog presentation\nThe parent dialog needs to either integrate the embedded dialog in its layout or open it in an own model window.\nEmbedding dialog core\nThe parent dialog needs to be able to access the embedded instance of its children. This allows initializing and changing their data and states. On the other hand the children might require context information offered by the parent dialog by registering services in the hierarchical service registry.\nDialog flow\nApart from the embedding of dialog components representing a tight coupling, dialogs can interact with each other by passing the control of the UI, i.e. switching from one dialog to another.\nWhen interacting, dialog components should interact only between the same or lower layers, i.e. the dialog core should not access the presentation layer of another dialog component.\n"},{"id":698,"path":"../..\\..\\..\\..\\..\\xampp\\htdocs\\devonfw.github.io\\website\\pages\\docs/master-devon4ng.asciidoc_architecture.html#meta-architecture.asciidoc_appendix","type":"docs","title":"Appendix","body":"15.2.3. Appendix\nNotes about Quasar Client\nThe Quasar client architecture as the consolidated knowledge of our CSD projects is the major source for the above drafted architecture. However, the above is a much simplified and more agile version thereof:\nQuasar Client tried to abstract from the concrete UI library being used, so it could decouple the business from the technical logic of a dialog. The presentation layer should be the only one knowing the concrete UI framework used. This level of abstraction was dropped in this reference architecture, although it might of course still make sense in some projects. For fast-moving agile projects in the web however introducing such a level of abstraction takes effort with little gained benefits. With frameworks like Angular 2 we would even introduce one additional seemingly artificial and redundant layer, since it already separates the dialog core from its presentation.\nIn the past and in the days of Struts, JSF, etc. the concept of session handling was important for the client since part of the client was sitting on a server with a session relating it to its remote counterpart on the users PC. Quasar Client catered for this need, by very prominently differentiating between session and application in the root of the dialog component hierarchy. However, in the current days of SPA applications and the lowered importance of servers-side web clients, this prominent differentiation was dropped. When still needed the referenced documents will provide in more detail how to tailor the respective architecture to this end.\n"},{"id":699,"path":"../..\\..\\..\\..\\..\\xampp\\htdocs\\devonfw.github.io\\website\\pages\\docs/master-devon4ng.asciidoc_architecture.html#meta-architecture.asciidoc_references","type":"docs","title":"References","body":"15.2.4.

Add Electron to an Angular application\nThis cookbook recipe explains how to integrate Electron in an Angular 10+ application. Electron is a framework for creating native applications with web technologies like JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. As an example, very well known applications as Visual Studio Code, Atom, Slack or Skype (and many more) are using Electron too.\nNote\nAt the moment of this writing Angular 11.2.0, Electron 11.2.3 and Electron-builder 22.9.1 were the versions available.\nHere are the steps to achieve this goal. Follow them in order.\nAdd Electron and other relevant dependencies\nThere are two different approaches to add the dependencies in the package.json file:\nWriting the dependencies directly in that file.\nInstalling using npm install or yarn add.\nImportant\nPlease remember if the project has a package-lock.json or yarn.lock file use npm or yarn respectively.\nIn order to add the dependencies directly in the package.json file, include the following lines in the devDependencies section:\n&quot;devDependencies&quot;: {\n...\n&quot;electron&quot;: &quot;^11.2.3&quot;,\n&quot;electron-builder&quot;: &quot;^22.9.1&quot;,\n...\n},\nAs indicated above, instead of this npm install can be used:\n$ npm install -D electron electron-builder\nOr with yarn:\n$ yarn add -D electron electron-builder\nCreate the necessary typescript configurations\nIn order to initiate electron in an angular app we need to modify the tsconfig.json file and create a tsconfig.serve.json and a tsconfig.base.json in the root folder.\ntsconfig.json\nThis file needs to be modified to create references to ./src/tsconfig.app.json and ./src/tsconfig.spec.json to support different configurations.\n{\n&quot;files&quot;: [],\n&quot;references&quot;: [\n{\n&quot;path&quot;: &quot;./src/tsconfig.app.json&quot;\n},\n{\n&quot;path&quot;: &quot;./src/tsconfig.spec.json&quot;\n}\n]\n}\ntsconfig.app.json\n{\n&quot;extends&quot;: &quot;../tsconfig.base.json&quot;,\n&quot;compilerOptions&quot;: {\n&quot;outDir&quot;: &quot;../app&quot;,\n&quot;module&quot;: &quot;es2015&quot;,\n&quot;baseUrl&quot;: &quot;&quot;,\n&quot;types&quot;: []\n},\n&quot;include&quot;: [\n&quot;**/*.ts&quot;,\n],\n&quot;exclude&quot;: [\n&quot;**/*.spec.ts&quot;\n],\n&quot;angularCompilerOptions&quot;: {\n&quot;fullTemplateTypeCheck&quot;: true,\n&quot;strictInjectionParameters&quot;: true,\n&quot;preserveWhitespaces&quot;: true\n}\n}\ntsconfig.spec.json\n{\n&quot;extends&quot;: &quot;../tsconfig.base.json&quot;,\n&quot;compilerOptions&quot;: {\n&quot;outDir&quot;: &quot;../spec&quot;,\n&quot;module&quot;: &quot;commonjs&quot;,\n&quot;types&quot;: [\n&quot;jasmine&quot;,\n&quot;node&quot;\n]\n},\n&quot;files&quot;: [\n&quot;test.ts&quot;,\n],\n&quot;include&quot;: [\n&quot;**/*.spec.ts&quot;,\n&quot;**/*.d.ts&quot;\n],\n&quot;exclude&quot;: [\n&quot;dist&quot;,\n&quot;release&quot;,\n&quot;node_modules&quot;\n]\n}\ntsconfig.base.json\nThis is shared betwen tsconfig.app.json and tsconfig.spec.json and it will be extended on each config file.\n{\n&quot;compileOnSave&quot;: false,\n&quot;compilerOptions&quot;: {\n&quot;outDir&quot;: &quot;./dist&quot;,\n&quot;sourceMap&quot;: true,\n&quot;declaration&quot;: false,\n&quot;moduleResolution&quot;: &quot;node&quot;,\n&quot;emitDecoratorMetadata&quot;: true,\n&quot;experimentalDecorators&quot;: true,\n&quot;target&quot;: &quot;es5&quot;,\n&quot;typeRoots&quot;: [\n&quot;node_modules/@types&quot;\n],\n&quot;lib&quot;: [\n&quot;es2017&quot;,\n&quot;es2016&quot;,\n&quot;es2015&quot;,\n&quot;dom&quot;\n]\n},\n&quot;files&quot;: [\n&quot;electron-main.ts&quot;\n&quot;src/polyfills.ts&quot;\n],\n&quot;include&quot;: [\n&quot;src/**/*.d.ts&quot;\n],\n&quot;exclude&quot;: [\n&quot;node_modules&quot;\n]\n}\ntsconfig.serve.json\nIn the root, tsconfig.serve.json needs to be created. This typescript config file is going to be used when we serve electron:\n{\n&quot;compilerOptions&quot;: {\n&quot;outDir&quot;: &quot;.&quot;,\n&quot;sourceMap&quot;: true,\n&quot;declaration&quot;: false,\n&quot;moduleResolution&quot;: &quot;node&quot;,\n&quot;emitDecoratorMetadata&quot;: true,\n&quot;experimentalDecorators&quot;: true,\n&quot;target&quot;: &quot;es5&quot;,\n&quot;typeRoots&quot;: [\n&quot;node_modules/@types&quot;\n],\n&quot;lib&quot;: [\n&quot;es2017&quot;,\n&quot;dom&quot;\n]\n},\n&quot;include&quot;: [\n&quot;electron-main.ts&quot;\n],\n&quot;exclude&quot;: [\n&quot;node_modules&quot;,\n&quot;**/*.spec.ts&quot;\n]\n}\nAdd Electron build configuration\nIn order to configure electron builds properly we need to create a new json on our application, let&#x2019;s call it electron-builder.json. For more information and fine tuning please refer to the Electron Builder official documentation.\nThe contents of the file will be something similar to the following:\n{\n&quot;productName&quot;: &quot;devon4ngElectron&quot;,\n&quot;directories&quot;:{\n&quot;output&quot;: &quot;./builder-release&quot;\n},\n&quot;win&quot;: {\n&quot;icon&quot;: &quot;dist/assets/icons&quot;,\n&quot;target&quot;: [\n&quot;portable&quot;\n]\n},\n&quot;mac&quot;: {\n&quot;icon&quot;: &quot;dist/assets/icons&quot;,\n&quot;target&quot;: [\n&quot;dmg&quot;\n]\n},\n&quot;linux&quot;: {\n&quot;icon&quot;: &quot;dist/assets/icons&quot;,\n&quot;target&quot;: [\n&quot;AppImage&quot;\n]\n}\n}\nTheres two important things in this files:\n&quot;output&quot;: this is where electron builder is going to build our application\n&quot;icon&quot;: in every OS possible theres an icon parameter, the route to the icon folder that will be created after building with angular needs to be used here. This will make it so the electron builder can find the icons and build.\nModify angular.json\nangular.json has to to be modified so the project is build inside /dist without an intermediate folder.\n{\n&quot;architect&quot;: {\n&quot;build&quot;: {\n&quot;outputPath&quot;: &quot;dist&quot;\n}\n}\n}\nCreate the electron window in electron-main.ts\nIn order to use electron, a file needs to be created at the root of the application (main.ts). This file will create a window with different settings checking if we are using --serve as an argument:\nimport { app, BrowserWindow } from &apos;electron&apos;;\nimport * as path from &apos;path&apos;;\nimport * as url from &apos;url&apos;;\nlet win: any;\nconst args: any = process.argv.slice(1);\nconst serve: any = args.some((val) =&gt; val === &apos;--serve&apos;);\nconst createWindow:any = ()=&gt;{\n// Create the browser window.\nwin = new BrowserWindow({\nfullscreen: true,\nwebPreferences: {\nnodeIntegration: true,\n}\n});\nif (serve) {\nrequire(&apos;electron-reload&apos;)(__dirname, {\nelectron: require(`${__dirname}/node_modules/electron`)\n});\nwin.loadURL(&apos;http://localhost:4200&apos;);\n} else {\nwin.loadURL(\nurl.format({\npathname: path.join(__dirname, &apos;dist/index.html&apos;),\nprotocol: &apos;file:&apos;,\nslashes: true\n})\n);\n}\nif (serve) {\nwin.webContents.openDevTools();\n}\n// Emitted when the window is closed.\nwin.on(&apos;closed&apos;, () =&gt; {\n// Dereference the window object, usually you would store window\n// in an array if your app supports multi windows, this is the time\n// when you should delete the corresponding element.\n// tslint:disable-next-line:no-null-keyword\nwin = null;\n});\n}\ntry {\n// This method will be called when Electron has finished\n// initialization and is ready to create browser windows.\n// Some APIs can only be used after this event occurs.\napp.on(&apos;ready&apos;, createWindow);\n// Quit when all windows are closed.\napp.on(&apos;window-all-closed&apos;, () =&gt; {\n// On OS X it is common for applications and their menu bar\n// to stay active until the user quits explicitly with Cmd + Q\nif (process.platform !== &apos;darwin&apos;) {\napp.quit();\n}\n});\napp.on(&apos;activate&apos;, () =&gt; {\n// On OS X it&apos;s common to re-create a window in the app when the\n// dock icon is clicked and there are no other windows open.\nif (win === null) {\ncreateWindow();\n}\n});\n} catch (e) {\n// Catch Error\n// throw e;\n}\nAdd the electron window and improve the package.json scripts\nInside package.json the electron window that will be transformed to electron-main.js when building needs to be added.\n{\n....\n&quot;main&quot;: &quot;electron-main.js&quot;,\n&quot;scripts&quot;: {...}\n....\n}\nThe scripts section in the package.json can be improved to avoid running too verbose commands. As a very complete example we can take a look to the My Thai Star&#x2019;s scripts section and copy the lines useful in your project. In any case, at least we recommend to add the following lines:\n&quot;scripts&quot;: {\n&quot;ng&quot;: &quot;ng&quot;,\n&quot;start&quot;: &quot;ng serve&quot;,\n&quot;build&quot;: &quot;ng build&quot;,\n&quot;test&quot;: &quot;ng test&quot;,\n&quot;lint&quot;: &quot;ng lint&quot;,\n&quot;e2e&quot;: &quot;ng e2e&quot;,\n&quot;electron:tsc&quot;: &quot;tsc -p tsconfig.serve.json&quot;,\n&quot;electron:run&quot;: &quot;npm run electron:tsc &amp;&amp; ng build --base-href ./ &amp;&amp; npx electron .&quot;,\n&quot;electron:serve&quot;: &quot;npm run electron:tsc &amp;&amp; npx electron . --serve&quot;,\n&quot;electron:pack&quot;: &quot;npm run electron:tsc &amp;&amp; electron-builder --dir --config electron-builder.json&quot;,\n&quot;electron:build&quot;: &quot;npm run electron:tsc &amp;&amp; electron-builder --config electron-builder.json build&quot;\n},\nThe electron: scripts do the following:\nelectron:tsc: Compiles electron TS files.\nelectron:run: Serves Angular app and runs electron.\nelectron:serve: Serves electron with an already running angular app (i.e. a ng serve command running on another terminal).\nelectron:pack: Packs electron app.\nelectron:build: Builds electron app.\n"},{"id":703,"path":"../..\\..\\..\\..\\..\\xampp\\htdocs\\devonfw.github.io\\website\\pages\\docs/master-devon4ng.asciidoc_cookbook.html#guide-angular-mock-service.asciidoc","type":"docs","title":"Angular Mock Service","body":"22.2.

Everything from rules to auto-fixing capabilities and more.\nHowever, the backers behind TSLint announced in 2019 that they would be deprecating TSLint in favor of supporting typescript-eslint in order to benefit the community. You can read more about that here: https://medium.com/palantir/tslint-in-2019-1a144c2317a9\nThe TypeScript Team themselves also announced their plans to move the TypeScript codebase from TSLint to typescript-eslint, and they have been big supporters of this project.

Introduction\nThis document aims to provide you the necessary documentation and sources in order to help you understand the importance of dependencies between packages.\nProjects in node.js make use of modules, chunks of reusable code made by other people or teams. These small chunks of reusable code are called packages [1]. Packages are used to solve specific problems or tasks. These relations between your project and the external packages are called dependencies.\nFor example, imagine we are doing a small program that takes your birthday as an input and tells you how many days are left until your birthday. We search in the repository if someone has published a package to retrieve the actual date and manage date types, and maybe we could search for another package to show a calendar, because we want to optimize our time, and we wish the user to click a calendar button and choose the day in the calendar instead of typing it.\nAs you can see, packages are convenient. In some cases, they may be even needed, as they can manage aspects of your program you may not be proficient in, or provide an easier use of them.\nFor more comprehensive information visit npm definition\nPackage.json\nDependencies in your project are stored in a file called package.json. Every package.json must contain, at least, the name and version of your project.\nPackage.json is located in the root of your project.\nImportant\nIf package.json is not on your root directory refer to Problems you may encounter section\nIf you wish to learn more information about package.json, click on the following links:\nYarn Package.json\nnpm Package.json\nContent of package.json\nAs you noticed, package.json is a really important file in your project. It contains essential information about our project, therefore you need to understand what&#x2019;s inside.\nThe structure of package.json is divided in blocks, inside the first one you can find essential information of your project such as the name, version, license and optionally some Scripts.\n{\n&quot;name&quot;: &quot;exampleproject&quot;,\n&quot;version&quot;: &quot;0.0.0&quot;,\n&quot;license&quot;: &quot;MIT&quot;,\n&quot;scripts&quot;: {\n&quot;ng&quot;: &quot;ng&quot;,\n&quot;start&quot;: &quot;ng serve&quot;,\n&quot;build&quot;: &quot;ng build&quot;,\n&quot;test&quot;: &quot;ng test&quot;,\n&quot;lint&quot;: &quot;ng lint&quot;,\n&quot;e2e&quot;: &quot;ng e2e&quot;\n}\nThe next block is called dependencies and contains the packages that project needs in order to be developed, compiled and executed.\n&quot;private&quot;: true,\n&quot;dependencies&quot;: {\n&quot;@angular/animations&quot;: &quot;^4.2.4&quot;,\n&quot;@angular/common&quot;: &quot;^4.2.4&quot;,\n&quot;@angular/forms&quot;: &quot;^4.2.4&quot;,\n...\n&quot;zone.js&quot;: &quot;^0.8.14&quot;\n}\nAfter dependencies we find devDependencies, another kind of dependencies present in the development of the application but unnecessary for its execution. One example is typescript. Code is written in typescript, and then, transpiled to javascript. This means the application is not using typescript in execution and consequently not included in the deployment of our application.\n&quot;devDependencies&quot;: {\n&quot;@angular/cli&quot;: &quot;1.4.9&quot;,\n&quot;@angular/compiler-cli&quot;: &quot;^4.2.4&quot;,\n...\n&quot;@types/node&quot;: &quot;~6.0.60&quot;,\n&quot;typescript&quot;: &quot;~2.3.3&quot;\n}\nHaving a peer dependency means that your package needs a dependency that is the same exact dependency as the person installing your package\n&quot;peerDependencies&quot;: {\n&quot;package-123&quot;: &quot;^2.7.18&quot;\n}\nOptional dependencies are just that: optional. If they fail to install, Yarn will still say the install process was successful.\n&quot;optionalDependencies&quot;: {\n&quot;package-321&quot;: &quot;^2.7.18&quot;\n}\nFinally you can have bundled dependencies which are packages bundled together when publishing your package in a repository.\n{\n&quot;bundledDependencies&quot;: [\n&quot;package-4&quot;\n]\n}\nHere is the link to an in-depth explanation of dependency types&#x200B;.\nScripts\nScripts are a great way of automating tasks related to your package, such as simple build processes or development tools.\nFor example:\n{\n&quot;name&quot;: &quot;exampleproject&quot;,\n&quot;version&quot;: &quot;0.0.0&quot;,\n&quot;license&quot;: &quot;MIT&quot;,\n&quot;scripts&quot;: {\n&quot;build-project&quot;: &quot;node hello-world.js&quot;,\n}\nYou can run that script by running the command yarn (run) script or npm run script, check the example below:\n$ yarn (run) build-project # run is optional\n$ npm run build-project\nThere are special reserved words for scripts, like preinstall, which will execute the script automatically\nbefore the package you install are installed.\nChech different uses for scripts in the following links:\nYarn scripts documentation\nnpm scripts documentation\nOr you can go back to\nContent of package.json&#x200B;.\nManaging dependencies\nIn order to manage dependencies we recommend using package managers in your projects.\nA big reason is their usability. Adding or removing a package is really easy, and by doing so, packet manager update the package.json and copies (or removes) the package in the needed location, with a single comand.\nAnother reason, closely related to the first one, is reducing human error by automating the package management process.\nTwo of the package managers you can use in node.js projects are &quot;yarn&quot; and &quot;npm&quot;. While you can use both, we encourage you to use only one of them while working on projects. Using both may lead to different dependencies between members of the team.\nnpm\nWe&#x2019;ll start by installing npm following this small guide here.\nAs stated on the web, npm comes inside of node.js, and must be updated after installing node.js, in the same guide you used earlier are written the instructions to update npm.\nHow npm works\nIn order to explain how npms works, let&#x2019;s take a command as an example:\n$ npm install @angular/material @angular/cdk\nThis command tells npm to look for the packages @angular/material and @angular/cdk in the npm registry, download and decompress them in the folder node_modules along with their own dependencies. Additionally, npm will update package.json and create a new file called package-lock.json.\nAfter initializating and installing the first package there will be a new folder called node_modules in your project. This folder is where your packages are unzipped and stored, following a tree scheme.\nTake in consideration both npm and yarn need a package.json in the root of your project in order to work properly. If after creating your project don&#x2019;t have it, download again the package.json from the repository or you&#x2019;ll have to start again.\nBrief overview of commands\nIf we need to create a package.json from scratch, we can use the comand init. This command asks the user for basic information about the project and creates a brand new package.json.\n$ npm init\nInstall (or i) installs all modules listed as dependencies in package.json locally. You can also specify a package, and install that package. Install can also be used with the parameter -g, which tells npm to install the Global package.\n$ npm install\n$ npm i\n$ npm install Package\nNote\nEarlier versions of npm did not add dependencies to package.json unless it was used with the flag --save, so npm install package would be npm install --save package, you have one example below.\n$ npm install --save Package\nNpm needs flags in order to know what kind of dependency you want in your project, in npm you need to put the flag -D or --save-dev to install devdependencies, for more information consult the links at the end of this section.\n$ npm install -D package\n$ npm install --save-dev package\n&#x200B;\nThe next command uninstalls the module you specified in the command.\n$ npm uninstall Package\nls command shows us the dependencies like a nested tree, useful if you have few packages, not so useful when you need a lot of packages.\n$ npm ls\nnpm@@VERSION@ /path/to/npm\n&#x2514;&#x2500;&#x252C; init-package-json@0.0.4\n&#x2514;&#x2500;&#x2500; promzard@0.1.5\nexample tree\nWe recommend you to learn more about npm commands in the following link, navigating to the section cli commands.\nAbout Package-lock.json\nPackage-lock.json describes the dependency tree resulting of using package.json and npm.\nWhenever you update, add or remove a package, package-lock.json is deleted and redone with\nthe new dependencies.\n&quot;@angular/animations&quot;: {\n&quot;version&quot;: &quot;4.4.6&quot;,\n&quot;resolved&quot;: &quot;https://registry.npmjs.org/@angular/animations/-/animations-4.4.6.tgz&quot;,\n&quot;integrity&quot;: &quot;sha1-+mYYmaik44y3xYPHpcl85l1ZKjU=&quot;,\n&quot;requires&quot;: {\n&quot;tslib&quot;: &quot;1.8.0&quot;\n}\nThis lock file is checked everytime the command npm i (or npm install) is used without specifying a package,\nin the case it exists and it&#x2019;s valid, npm will install the exact tree that was generated, such that subsequent\ninstalls are able to generate identical dependency trees.\nWarning\nIt is not recommended to modify this file yourself. It&#x2019;s better to leave its management to npm.\nMore information is provided by the npm team at package-lock.json\nYarn\nYarn is an alternative to npm, if you wish to install yarn follow the guide getting started with yarn and download the correct version for your operative system. Node.js is also needed you can find it here.\nWorking with yarn\nYarn is used like npm, with small differences in syntax, for example npm install module is changed to yarn add module.\n$ yarn add @covalent\nThis command is going to download the required packages, modify package.json, put the package in the folder node_modules and makes a new yarn.lock with the new dependency.\nHowever, unlike npm, yarn maintains a cache with packages you download inside. You don&#x2019;t need to download every file every time you do a general installation. This means installations faster than npm.\nSimilarly to npm, yarn creates and maintains his own lock file, called yarn.lock. Yarn.lock gives enough information about the project for dependency tree to be reproduced.\nyarn commands\nHere we have a brief description of yarn&#x2019;s most used commands:\n$ yarn add Package\n$ yarn add --dev Package\nAdds a package locally to use in your package. Adding the flags --dev or -D will add them to devDependencies instead of the default dependencies, if you need more information check the links at the end of the section.\n$ yarn init\nInitializes the development of a package.\n$ yarn install\nInstalls all the dependencies defined in a package.json file, you can also write &quot;yarn&quot; to achieve the same effect.\n$ yarn remove Package\nYou use it when you wish to remove a package from your project.\n$ yarn global add Package\nInstalls the Global package.\nPlease, refer to the documentation to learn more about yarn commands and their attributes: yarn commands\nyarn.lock\nThis file has the same purpose as Package-lock.json, to guide the packet manager, in this case yarn,\nto install the dependency tree specified in yarn.lock.\nYarn.lock and package.json are\nessential files when collaborating in a project more co-workers and may be a\nsource of errors if programmers do not use the same manager.\nYarn.lock follows the same structure as package-lock.json, you can find an example of dependency below:\n&quot;@angular/animations@^4.2.4&quot;:\nversion &quot;4.4.6&quot;\nresolved &quot;https://registry.yarnpkg.com/@angular/animations/-/animations-4.4.6.tgz#fa661899a8a4e38cb7c583c7a5c97ce65d592a35&quot;\ndependencies:\ntslib &quot;^1.7.1&quot;\nWarning\nAs with package-lock.json, it&#x2019;s strongly not adviced to modify this file. Leave its management to yarn\nYou can learn more about yarn.lock here: yarn.lock\nGlobal package\nGlobal packages are packages installed in your operative system instead of your local project,\nglobal packages useful for developer tooling that is not part of any individual project but instead is used for local commands.\nA good example of global package is angular/cli, a command line interface for angular used in our projects. You can install\na global package in npm with &quot;npm install -g package&quot; and &quot;yarn global add package&quot; with yarn, you have a npm example below:\nListing 16. npm global package\nnpm install &#x2013;g @angular/cli\nGlobal npm\nGlobal yarn\nPackage version\nDependencies are critical to the success of a package. You must be extra careful about\nwhich version packages are using, one package in a different version may break your code.\nVersioning in npm and yarn, follows a semantic called semver, following the logic\nMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, like for example, @angular/animations: 4.4.6.\nDifferent versions\nSometimes, packages are installed with a different version from the one initially installed.\nThis happens because package.json also contains the range of versions we allow yarn or npm to\ninstall or update to, example:\n&quot;@angular/animations&quot;: &quot;^4.2.4&quot;\nAnd here the installed one:\n&quot;@angular/animations&quot;: {\n&quot;version&quot;: &quot;4.4.6&quot;,\n&quot;resolved&quot;: &quot;https://registry.npmjs.org/@angular/animations/-/animations-4.4.6.tgz&quot;,\n&quot;integrity&quot;: &quot;sha1-+mYYmaik44y3xYPHpcl85l1ZKjU=&quot;,\n&quot;requires&quot;: {\n&quot;tslib&quot;: &quot;1.8.0&quot;\n}\nAs you can see, the version we initially added is 4.2.4, and the version finally installed after\na global installation of all packages, 4.4.6.\nInstalling packages without package-lock.json or yarn.lock using their respective packet managers, will always\nend with npm or yarn installing the latest version allowed by package.json.\n&quot;@angular/animations&quot;: &quot;^4.2.4&quot; contains not only the version we added, but also the range we allow npm and yarn\nto update. Here are some examples:\n&quot;@angular/animations&quot;: &quot;&lt;4.2.4&quot;\nThe version installed must be lower than 4.2.4 .\n&quot;@angular/animations&quot;: &quot;&gt;=4.2.4&quot;\nThe version installed must be greater than or equal to 4.2.4 .\n&quot;@angular/animations&quot;: &quot;=4.2.4&quot;\nthe version installed must be equal to 4.2.4 .\n&quot;@angular/animations&quot;: &quot;^4.2.4&quot;\nThe version installed cannot modify the first non zero digit, for example in this case\nit cannot surpass 5.0.0 or be lower than 4.2.4 .\nYou can learn more about this in Versions\nProblems you may encounter\nIf you can&#x2019;t find package.json, you may have deleted the one you had previously,\nwhich means you have to download the package.json from the repository.\nIn the case you are creating a new project you can create a new package.json. More information\nin the links below. Click on Package.json if you come from that section. \nCreating new package.json in yarn\nCreating new package.json in npm\nImportant\nUsing npm install or yarn without package.json in your projects will\nresult in compilation errors. As we mentioned earlier,\nPackage.json contains essential information about your project.\nIf you have package.json, but you don&#x2019;t have package-lock.json or yarn.lock the use of\ncommand &quot;npm install&quot; or &quot;yarn&quot; may result in a different dependency tree.\nIf you are trying to import a module and visual code studio is not able to find it,\nis usually caused by error adding the package to the project, try to add the module again with yarn or npm,\nand restart Visual Studio Code.\nBe careful with the semantic versioning inside your package.json of the packages,\nor you may find a new update on one of your dependencies breaking your code.\nTip\nIn the following link\nthere is a solution to a problematic update to one package.\nA list of common errors of npm can be found in: npm errors\nRecomendations\nUse yarn or npm in your project, reach an agreement with your team in order to choose one, this will avoid\nundesired situations like forgetting to upload an updated yarn.lock or package-lock.json.\nBe sure to have the latest version of your project when possible.\nTip\nPull your project every time it&#x2019;s updated. Erase your node_modules folder and reinstall all\ndependencies. This assures you to be working with the same dependencies your team has.\nAD Center recommends the use of yarn.\n"},{"id":731,"path":"../..\\..\\..\\..\\..\\xampp\\htdocs\\devonfw.github.io\\website\\pages\\docs/master-devon4ng.asciidoc_guides.html#guide-yarn-2-support.asciidoc","type":"docs","title":"Yarn 2","body":"17.3.

Ionic uses an angular.json file to store those configurations and some rules to be applied.\nIf a back-end is hosted on http://localhost:8081, and that direction is used in every environment, the application built for android will not work because computer and device do not have the same localhost. Fortunately, different configurations can be defined.\nAndroid Studio uses 10.0.0.2 as alias for 127.0.0.1 (computer&#x2019;s localhost) so adding http//10.0.0.2:8081 in a new environment file and modifying angular.json accordingly, will make possible connect front-end and back-end.\n&quot;build&quot;: {\n...\n&quot;configurations&quot;: {\n...\n&quot;android&quot;: {\n&quot;fileReplacements&quot;: [\n{\n&quot;replace&quot;: &quot;src/environments/environment.ts&quot;,\n&quot;with&quot;: &quot;src/environments/environment.android.ts&quot;\n}\n]\n},\n}\n}\nBuild\nOnce configured, it is necessary to build the Ionic app using this new configuration:\nionic build --configuration=android\nThe next commands copy the build application on a folder named android and open android studio.\nnpx cap add android\nnpx cap copy\nnpx cap open android\n"},{"id":747,"path":"../..\\..\\..\\..\\..\\xampp\\htdocs\\devonfw.github.io\\website\\pages\\docs/master-devon4ng.asciidoc_ionic.html#guide-ionic-from-code-to-android.asciidoc_from-android-project-to-emulated-device","type":"docs","title":"From Android project to emulated device","body":"19.3.3.

Sample Application\nFigure 55. Basic ionic PWA.\nTo explain how to build progressive web apps (PWA) using Ionic, a basic application is going to be built. This app will be able to take photos even without network using PWA elements.\nStep 1: Create a new project\nThis step can be completed with one simple command: ionic start &lt;name&gt; &lt;template&gt;, where &lt;name&gt; is the name and &lt;template&gt; a model for the app. In this case, the app is going to be named basic-ion-pwa.\nStep 2: Structures and styles\nThe styles (scss) and structures (html) do not have anything specially relevant, just colors and ionic web components. The code can be found in devon4ng samples.\nStep 3: Add functionality\nAfter this step, the app will allow users take photos and display them in the main screen.\nFirst we have to import three important elements:\nDomSanitizer: Sanitizes values to be safe to use.\nSafeResourceUrl: Interface for values that are safe to use as URL.\nPlugins: Capacitor constant value used to access to the device&#x2019;s camera and toast dialogs.\nimport { DomSanitizer, SafeResourceUrl } from &apos;@angular/platform-browser&apos;;\nimport { Plugins, CameraResultType } from &apos;@capacitor/core&apos;;\nconst { Camera, Toast } = Plugins;\nThe process of taking a picture is enclosed in a takePicture method. takePicture calls the Camera&#x2019;s getPhoto function which returs an URL or an exception. If a photo is taken then the image displayed in the main page will be changed for the new picture, else, if the app is closed without changing it, a toast message will be displayed.\nexport class HomePage {\nimage: SafeResourceUrl;\n...\nasync takePicture() {\ntry {\nconst image = await Camera.getPhoto({\nquality: 90,\nallowEditing: true,\nresultType: CameraResultType.Uri,\n});\n// Change last picture shown\nthis.image = this.sanitizer.bypassSecurityTrustResourceUrl(image.webPath);\n} catch (e) {\nthis.show(&apos;Closing camera&apos;);\n}\n}\nasync show(message: string) {\nawait Toast.show({\ntext: message,\n});\n}\n}\nStep 4: PWA Elements\nWhen Ionic apps are not running natively, some resources like Camera do not work by default but can be enabled using PWA Elements. To use Capacitor&#x2019;s PWA elements run npm install @ionic/pwa-elements and modify src/main.ts as shown below.\n...\n// Import for PWA elements\nimport { defineCustomElements } from &apos;@ionic/pwa-elements/loader&apos;;\nif (environment.production) {\nenableProdMode();\n}\nplatformBrowserDynamic().bootstrapModule(AppModule)\n.catch(err =&gt; console.log(err));\n// Call the element loader after the platform has been bootstrapped\ndefineCustomElements(window);\nStep 5: Make it Progressive.\nTurining an Ionic 5 app into a PWA is pretty easy, the same module used to turn Angular apps into PWAs has to be added, to do so, run: ng add @angular/pwa. This command also creates an icons folder inside src/assets and contains angular icons for multiple resolutions. If you want use other images, be sure that they have the same resolution, the names can be different but the file manifest.json has to be changed accordingly.\nStep 6: Configure the app\nmanifest.json\nDefault configuration.\nngsw-config.json\nAt assetGroups &#x2192; resources add a urls field and a pattern to match PWA Elements scripts and other resources (images, styles, &#x2026;&#x200B;):\n&quot;urls&quot;: [&quot;https://unpkg.com/@ionic/pwa-elements@1.0.2/dist/**&quot;]\nStep 7: Check that your app is a PWA\nTo check if an app is a PWA lets compare its normal behaviour against itself but built for production. Run in the project&#x2019;s root folder the commands below:\nionic build --prod to build the app using production settings.\nnpm install http-server to install an npm module that can serve your built application. Documentation here. A good alternative is also npm install serve. It can be checked here.\nGo to the www folder running cd www.\nhttp-server -o or serve to serve your built app.\nNote\nIn order not to install anything not necessary npx can be used directly to serve the app. i.e run npx serve [folder] will automatically download and run this HTTP server without installing it in the project dependencies.\nFigure 56. Http server running on localhost:8081.\n&#xA0;\nIn another console instance run ionic serve to open the common app (not built).\nFigure 57. Ionic server running on localhost:8100.\n&#xA0;\nThe first difference can be found on Developer tools &#x2192; application, here it is seen that the PWA application (left) has a service worker and the common one does not.\nFigure 58. Application service worker comparison.\n&#xA0;\nIf the &quot;offline&quot; box is checked, it will force a disconnection from network. In situations where users do not have connectivity or have a slow, one the PWA can still be accesed and used.\nFigure 59. Offline application.\n&#xA0;\nFinally, plugins like Lighthouse can be used to test whether an application is progressive or not.\nFigure 60.

Interaction of Smart Components through the services layer\nThe interaction of smart components is a classic problem which has to be solved in every UI technology.\nIt is basically how one dialog tells the other something has changed.\nAn example is adding an item to the shopping basket.\nWith this action there need to be multiple state updates.\nThe small logo showing how many items are currently inside the basket needs to be updated from 0 to 1\nThe price needs to be recalculated\nShipping costs need to be checked\nDiscounts need to be updated\nAds need to be updated with related products\netc.\nPattern\nTo handle this interaction in a scalable way we apply the following pattern.\nFigure 17. Smart Component interaction\nThe state of interest is encapsualted inside a store. All Smart Components interested in the state have to subscibe to the store&#x2019;s API served by the public observable. Thus, with every update to the store the subscribed components receive the new value. The components basically react to state changes. Altering a store can be done directly if the desired change is synchronous. Most actions are of asynchronous nature so the UseCaseService comes into play. Its actions are void methods, which implement a use case, i.e., adding a new item to the basket. It calls asynchronous actions and can perform multiple store updates over time.\nTo put this pattern into perspective the UseCaseService is a programmatic alternative to redux-thunk or @ngrx/effects. The main motivation here is to use the full power of TypeScript&#x2019;s --strictNullChecks and to let the learning curve not to become as steep as it would be when learning a new state management framework. This way actions are just void method calls.\nExample\nFigure 18. Smart Components interaction example\nThe example shows two Smart Components sharing the FlightSearchState by using the FlightSearchStore.\nThe use case shown is started by an event in the Smart Component FlightSearchComponent. The action loadFlight() is called. This could be submitting a search form.\nThe UseCaseService is FlightSearchService, which handles the use case Load Flights.\nUseCaseService example\nexport class FlightSearchService {\nconstructor(\nprivate flightSearchAdapter: FlightSearchAdapter,\nprivate store: FlightSearchStore\n) { }\nloadFlights(criteria: FlightSearchCriteria): void {\nthis.store.setLoadingFlights(true);\nthis.store.clearFlights();\nthis.flightSearchAdapter.getFlights(criteria.departureDate,\n{\nfrom: criteria.departureAirport,\nto: criteria.destinationAirport\n})\n.finally(() =&gt; this.store.setLoadingFlights(false))\n.subscribe((result: FlightTo[]) =&gt; this.store.setFlights(result, criteria));\n}\n}\nFirst the loading flag is set to true and the current flights are cleared. This leads the Smart Component showing a spinner indicating the loading action. Then the asynchronous XHR is triggert by calling the adapter. After completion the loading flag is set to false causing the loading indication no longer to be shown. If the XHR was successful, the data would be put into the store. If the XHR was not successful, this would be the place to handle a custom error. All general network issues should be handled in a dedicated class, i.e., an interceptor. So for example the basic handling of 404 errors is not done here.\n&#x2190;&#xA0;Previous:&#xA0;Architecture&#xA0;| &#x2191;&#xA0;Up:&#xA0;devon4ng&#xA0;| &#x2302;&#xA0;Home:&#xA0;devonfw guide&#xA0;| Next:&#xA0;Guides&#xA0;&#x2192;\n"},{"id":763,"path":"../..\\..\\..\\..\\..\\xampp\\htdocs\\devonfw.github.io\\website\\pages\\docs/master-devon4ng.asciidoc_layouts.html#master-devon4ng.asciidoc_layouts","type":"docs","title":"Layouts","body":"20.

Adding Angular Material library to the project\nNext we will add Angular Material to our application. In the integrated terminal, press Ctrl + C to terminate the running application and run the following command:\nnpm install --save @angular/material @angular/cdk @angular/animations\nYou can also use Yarn to install the dependencies if you prefer that:\nyarn add @angular/material @angular/cdk @angular/animations\nOnce the dependencies are installed, we need to import the BrowserAnimationsModule in our AppModule for animations support.\nListing 68. Importing BrowserAnimationsModule in AppModule\nimport {BrowserAnimationsModule} from &apos;@angular/platform-browser/animations&apos;;\n@NgModule({\n...\nimports: [BrowserAnimationsModule],\n...\n})\nexport class AppModule { }\nAngular Material provides a host of components for designing our application. All the components are well structured into NgModules. For each component from the Angular Material library that we want to use, we have to import the respective NgModule.\nListing 69. We will be using the following components in our application:\nimport { MatIconModule, MatButtonModule, MatMenuModule, MatListModule, MatToolbarModule, MatSidenavModule } from &apos;@angular/material&apos;;\n@NgModule({\n...\nimports: [\n...\nMatIconModule,\nMatButtonModule,\nMatMenuModule,\nMatListModule,\nMatToolbarModule,\nMatSidenavModule,\n...\n],\n...\n})\nexport class AppModule { }\nA better approach is to import and then export all the required components in a shared module. But for the sake of simplicity, we are importing all the required components in the AppModule itself.\nNext, we include a theme in our application. Angular Material comes with four inbuilt themes: indigo-pink, deeppurple-amber, pink-bluegrey and purple-green. It is also possible to create our own custom theme, but that is beyond the scope of this guide. Including a theme is required to apply all of the core and theme styles to your application.\nWe will include the indigo-pink theme in our application by importing the indigo-pink.css file in our src/styles.scss:\nListing 70. In src/styles.scss:\n@import &quot;~@angular/material/prebuilt-themes/indigo-pink.css&quot;;\nSome Angular Material components depend on HammerJs for gestures. So it is a good idea to install HammerJs as a dependency in our application. To do so, run the following command in the terminal:\nnpm install --save hammerjs\nThen import it in the src/main.ts file\nimport &apos;hammerjs&apos;;\nTo use Material Design Icons along with the mat-icon component, we will load the Material Icons library in our src/index.html file\nListing 71. In src/index.html:\n&lt;link href=&quot;https://fonts.googleapis.com/icon?family=Material+Icons&quot; rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot;&gt;\n"},{"id":767,"path":"../..\\..\\..\\..\\..\\xampp\\htdocs\\devonfw.github.io\\website\\pages\\docs/master-devon4ng.asciidoc_layouts.html#guide-layout-with-angular-material.asciidoc_development","type":"docs","title":"Development","body":"20.1.3. Development\nNow that we have all the Angular Material related dependencies set up in our project, we can start coding. Let&#x2019;s begin by adding a suitable margin and font to the body element of our single page application. We will add it in the src/styles.scss file to apply it globally:\nListing 72. In src/styles.scss:\nbody {\nmargin: 0;\nfont-family: &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, sans-serif;\n}\nAt this point, if we run our application with ng serve, this is how it will look like:\nFigure 63. Application with Angular Material set up\nWe will clear the app.component.html file and setup a header with a menu button and some navigational links. We will use mat-toolbar, mat-button, mat-menu, mat-icon and mat-icon-button for this:\nListing 73. app.component.html:\n&lt;mat-toolbar color=&quot;primary&quot;&gt;\n&lt;button mat-icon-button aria-label=&quot;menu&quot;&gt;\n&lt;mat-icon&gt;menu&lt;/mat-icon&gt;\n&lt;/button&gt;\n&lt;button mat-button [matMenuTriggerFor]=&quot;submenu&quot;&gt;Menu 1&lt;/button&gt;\n&lt;button mat-button&gt;Menu 2&lt;/button&gt;\n&lt;button mat-button&gt;Menu 3&lt;/button&gt;\n&lt;mat-menu #submenu=&quot;matMenu&quot;&gt;\n&lt;button mat-menu-item&gt;Sub-menu 1&lt;/button&gt;\n&lt;button mat-menu-item [matMenuTriggerFor]=&quot;submenu2&quot;&gt;Sub-menu 2&lt;/button&gt;\n&lt;/mat-menu&gt;\n&lt;mat-menu #submenu2=&quot;matMenu&quot;&gt;\n&lt;button mat-menu-item&gt;Menu Item 1&lt;/button&gt;\n&lt;button mat-menu-item&gt;Menu Item 2&lt;/button&gt;\n&lt;button mat-menu-item&gt;Menu Item 3&lt;/button&gt;\n&lt;/mat-menu&gt;\n&lt;/mat-toolbar&gt;\nThe color attribute on the mat-toolbar element will give it the primary (indigo) color as defined by our theme. The color attribute works with most Angular Material components; the possible values are &apos;primary&apos;, &apos;accent&apos; and &apos;warn&apos;.\nThe mat-toolbar is a suitable component to represent a header. It serves as a placeholder for elements we want in our header.\nInside the mat-toolbar, we start with a button having mat-icon-button attribute, which itself contains a mat-icon element having the value menu. This will serve as a menu button which we can use to toggle the sidenav.\nWe follow it with some sample buttons having the mat-button attribute. Notice the first button has a property matMenuTriggerFor binded to a local reference submenu. As the property name suggests, the click of this button will display the mat-menu element with the specified local reference as a drop-down menu. The rest of the code is self explanatory.\nFigure 64. This is how our application looks with the first menu button (Menu 1) clicked.\nWe want to keep the sidenav toggling menu button on the left and move the rest to the right to make it look better. To do this we add a class to the menu icon button:\nListing 74. app.component.html:\n...\n&lt;button mat-icon-button aria-label=&quot;menu&quot; class=&quot;menu&quot;&gt;\n&lt;mat-icon&gt;menu&lt;/mat-icon&gt;\n&lt;/button&gt;\n...\nAnd in the app.component.scss file, we add the following style:\nListing 75. app.component.scss:\n.menu {\nmargin-right: auto;\n}\nThe mat-toolbar element already has it&#x2019;s display property set to flex. Setting the menu icon button&#x2019;s margin-right property to auto keeps itself on the left and pushes the other elements to the right.\nFigure 65. Final look of the header.\nNext, we will create a sidenav. But before that lets create a couple of components to navgate between, the links of which we will add to the sidenav.\nWe will use the ng generate component (or ng g c command for short) to create Home and Data components. We nest them in the pages sub-directory since they represent our pages.\nng g c pages/home\nng g c pages/data&apos;;\nLet us set up the routing such that when we visit http://localhost:4200/ root url we see the HomeComponent and when we visit http://localhost:4200/data url we see the DataComponent.\nWe had opted for routing while creating the application, so we have the routing module app-routing.module.ts setup for us. In this file, we have the empty routes array where we set up our routes.\nListing 76. app-routing.module.ts:\n...\nimport { HomeComponent } from &apos;./pages/home/home.component&apos;;\nimport { DataComponent } from &apos;./pages/data/data.component&apos;;\nconst routes: Routes = [\n{ path: &apos;&apos;, component: HomeComponent },\n{ path: &apos;data&apos;, component: DataComponent }\n];\n...\nWe need to provide a hook where the components will be loaded when their respective URLs are loaded. We do that by using the router-outlet directive in the app.component.html.\nListing 77. app.component.html:\n...\n&lt;/mat-toolbar&gt;\n&lt;router-outlet&gt;&lt;/router-outlet&gt;\nNow when we visit the defined URLs we see the appropriate components rendered on screen.\nLets change the contents of the components to have something better.\nListing 78. home.component.html:\n&lt;h2&gt;Home Page&lt;/h2&gt;\nListing 79. home.component.scss:\nh2 {\ntext-align: center;\nmargin-top: 50px;\n}\nListing 80. data.component.html:\n&lt;h2&gt;Data Page&lt;/h2&gt;\nListing 81. data.component.scss:\nh2 {\ntext-align: center;\nmargin-top: 50px;\n}\nThe pages look somewhat better now:\nFigure 66. Home page\nFigure 67. Data page\nLet us finally create the sidenav. To implement the sidenav we need to use 3 Angular Material components: mat-sidenav-container, mat-sidenav and mat-sidenav-content.\nThe mat-sidenav-container, as the name suggests, acts as a container for the sidenav and the associated content. So it is the parent element, and mat-sidenav and mat-sidenav-content are the children sibling elements. mat-sidenav represents the sidenav. We can put any content we want, though it is usually used to conatain a list of navigational links. The mat-sidenav-content element is for conataining our main page content. Since we need the sidenav application-wide, we will put it in the app.component.html.\nListing 82. app.component.html:\n...\n&lt;/mat-toolbar&gt;\n&lt;mat-sidenav-container&gt;\n&lt;mat-sidenav mode=&quot;over&quot; [disableClose]=&quot;false&quot; #sidenav&gt;\nSidenav\n&lt;/mat-sidenav&gt;\n&lt;mat-sidenav-content&gt;\n&lt;router-outlet&gt;&lt;/router-outlet&gt;\n&lt;/mat-sidenav-content&gt;\n&lt;/mat-sidenav-container&gt;\nThe mat-sidenav has a mode property, which accepts one of the 3 values: over, push and side. It decides the behavior of the sidenav. mat-sidenav also has a disableClose property which accents a boolean value. It toggles the behavior where we click on the backdrop or press the Esc key to close the sidenav. There are other properties which we can use to customize the appearance, behavior and position of the sidenav. You can find the properties documented online at https://material.angular.io/components/sidenav/api\nWe moved the router-outlet directive inside the mat-sidenav-content where it will render the routed component.\nBut if you check the running application in the browser, we don&#x2019;t see the sidenav yet. That is because it is closed. We want to have the sidenav opened/closed at the click of the menu icon button on the left side of the header we implemented earlier. Notice we have set a local reference #sidenav on the mat-sidenav element. We can access this element and call its toggle() function to toggle open or close the sidenav.\nListing 83. app.component.html:\n...\n&lt;button mat-icon-button aria-label=&quot;menu&quot; class=&quot;menu&quot; (click)=&quot;sidenav.toggle()&quot;&gt;\n&lt;mat-icon&gt;menu&lt;/mat-icon&gt;\n&lt;/button&gt;\n...\nFigure 68. Sidenav is implemented\nWe can now open the sidenav by clicking the menu icon button. But it does not look right. The sidenav is only as wide as its content. Also the page does not stretch the entire viewport due to lack of content.\nLet&#x2019;s add the following styles to make the page fill the viewport:\nListing 84. app.component.scss:\n...\nmat-sidenav-container {\nposition: absolute;\ntop: 64px;\nleft: 0;\nright: 0;\nbottom: 0;\n}\nThe sidenav&#x2019;s width will be corrected when we add the navigational links to it. That is the only thing remaining to be done. Lets implement it now:\nListing 85. app.component.html:\n...\n&lt;mat-sidenav [disableClose]=&quot;false&quot; mode=&quot;over&quot; #sidenav&gt;\n&lt;mat-nav-list&gt;\n&lt;a\nid=&quot;home&quot;\nmat-list-item\n[routerLink]=&quot;[&apos;./&apos;]&quot;\n(click)=&quot;sidenav.close()&quot;\nrouterLinkActive=&quot;active&quot;\n[routerLinkActiveOptions]=&quot;{exact: true}&quot;\n&gt;\n&lt;mat-icon matListAvatar&gt;home&lt;/mat-icon&gt;\n&lt;h3 matLine&gt;Home&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p matLine&gt;sample home page&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a\nid=&quot;sampleData&quot;\nmat-list-item\n[routerLink]=&quot;[&apos;./data&apos;]&quot;\n(click)=&quot;sidenav.close()&quot;\nrouterLinkActive=&quot;active&quot;\n&gt;\n&lt;mat-icon matListAvatar&gt;grid_on&lt;/mat-icon&gt;\n&lt;h3 matLine&gt;Data&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p matLine&gt;sample data page&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;/mat-nav-list&gt;\n&lt;/mat-sidenav&gt;\n...\nWe use the mat-nav-list element to set a list of navigational links. We use the a tags with mat-list-item directive. We implement a click listener on each link to close the sidenav when it is clicked. The routerLink directive is used to provide the URLs to navigate to. The routerLinkActive directive is used to provide the class name which will be added to the link when it&#x2019;s URL is visited. Here we name the class`active`. To stye it, let&apos; modify the app.component.scss file:\nListing 86. app.component.scss:\n...\nmat-sidenav-container {\n...\na.active {\nbackground: #8e8d8d;\ncolor: #fff;\np {\ncolor: #4a4a4a;\n}\n}\n}\nNow we have a working application with a basic layout: a header with some menu and a sidenav with some navigational links.\nFigure 69.

The need for client side state management\nYou may wonder why you should bother with state management. Usually data resides in a backend storage system, e.g. a database, and is retrieved by the client on a per-need basis. To add, update, or delete entities from this store, clients have to invoke API endpoints at the backend. Mimicking database-like transactions on the client side may seem redundant. However, there are many use cases for which a global client-side state is appropriate:\nthe client has some kind of global state which should survive the destruction of a component, but does not warrant server side persistence, for example: volume level of media, expansion status of menus\nsever side data should not be retrieved every time it is needed, either because multiple components consume it, or because it should be cached, e.g. the personal watchlist in an online streaming app\nthe app provides a rich experience with offline functionality, e.g. a native app built with Ionic\nSaving global states inside the services they originates from results in a data flow that is hard to follow and state becoming inconsistent due to unordered state mutations. Following the single source of truth principle, there should be a central location holding all your application&#x2019;s state, just like a server side database does. State managament libraries for Angular provide tools for storing, retrieving, and updating client-side state.\n"},{"id":772,"path":"../..\\..\\..\\..\\..\\xampp\\htdocs\\devonfw.github.io\\website\\pages\\docs/master-devon4ng.asciidoc_ngrx.html#guide-ngrx-getting-started.asciidoc_why-ngrx","type":"docs","title":"Why NgRx?","body":"21.1.2. Why NgRx?\nAs stated in the introduction, devon4ng does not stipulate a particular state library, or require using one at all. However, NgRx has proven to be a robust, mature solution for this task, with good tooling and 3rd-party library support. Albeit introducing a level of indirection that requires additional effort even for simple features, the redux concept enforces a clear separation of concerns leading to a cleaner architecture.\nNonetheless, you should always compare different approaches to state management and pick the best one suiting your use case. Here&#x2019;s a (non-exhaustive) list of competing state management libraries:\nPlain Rxjs using the simple store described in Abstract Class Store\nNgXS reduces some boilerplate of NgRx by leveraging the power of decorators and moving side effects to the store\nMobX follows a more imperative approach in contrast to the functional Redux pattern\nAkita also uses an imperative approach with direct setters in the store, but keeps the concept of immutable state transitions\n"},{"id":773,"path":"../..\\..\\..\\..\\..\\xampp\\htdocs\\devonfw.github.io\\website\\pages\\docs/master-devon4ng.asciidoc_ngrx.html#guide-ngrx-getting-started.asciidoc_setup","type":"docs","title":"Setup","body":"21.1.3.

Creating a Simple Store\nIn the following pages we use the example of an online streaming service. We will model a particular feature, a watchlist that can be populated by the user with movies she or he wants to see in the future.\nInitializing NgRx\nIf you&#x2019;re starting fresh, you first have to initialize NgRx and create a root state. The fastest way to do this is using the schematic:\nng generate @ngrx/schematics:store State --root --module app.module.ts\nThis will automatically generate a root store and register it in the app module. Next we generate a feature module for the watchlist:\nng generate module watchlist\nand create a corresponding feature store:\nng generate store watchlist/Watchlist -m watchlist.module.ts\nThis generates a file watchlist/reducers/index.ts with the reducer function, and registers the store in the watchlist module declaration.\nWarning\nIf you&#x2019;re getting an error Schematic &quot;store&quot; not found in collection &quot;@schematics/angular&quot;, this means you forgot to register the NgRx schematics as default.\nNext, add the WatchlistModule to the AppModule imports so the feature store is registered when the application starts. We also added the store devtools which we will use later, resulting in the following file:\napp.module.ts\nimport { BrowserModule } from &apos;@angular/platform-browser&apos;;\nimport { NgModule } from &apos;@angular/core&apos;;\nimport { AppComponent } from &apos;./app.component&apos;;\nimport { EffectsModule } from &apos;@ngrx/effects&apos;;\nimport { AppEffects } from &apos;./app.effects&apos;;\nimport { StoreModule } from &apos;@ngrx/store&apos;;\nimport { reducers, metaReducers } from &apos;./reducers&apos;;\nimport { StoreDevtoolsModule } from &apos;@ngrx/store-devtools&apos;;\nimport { environment } from &apos;../environments/environment&apos;;\nimport { WatchlistModule } from &apos;./watchlist/watchlist.module&apos;;\n@NgModule({\ndeclarations: [\nAppComponent\n],\nimports: [\nBrowserModule,\nWatchlistModule,\nStoreModule.forRoot(reducers, { metaReducers }),\n// Instrumentation must be imported after importing StoreModule (config is optional)\nStoreDevtoolsModule.instrument({\nmaxAge: 25, // Retains last 25 states\nlogOnly: environment.production, // Restrict extension to log-only mode\n}),\n!environment.production ? StoreDevtoolsModule.instrument() : []\n],\nproviders: [],\nbootstrap: [AppComponent]\n})\nexport class AppModule { }\nCreate an entity model and initial state\nWe need a simple model for our list of movies. Create a file watchlist/models/movies.ts and insert the following code:\nexport interface Movie {\nid: number;\ntitle: string;\nreleaseYear: number;\nruntimeMinutes: number;\ngenre: Genre;\n}\nexport type Genre = &apos;action&apos; | &apos;fantasy&apos; | &apos;sci-fi&apos; | &apos;romantic&apos; | &apos;comedy&apos; | &apos;mystery&apos;;\nexport interface WatchlistItem {\nid: number;\nmovie: Movie;\nadded: Date;\nplaybackMinutes: number;\n}\nNote\nWe discourage putting several types into the same file and do this only for the sake of keeping this tutorial brief.\nLater we will learn how to retrieve data from the backend using effects. For now we will create an initial state for the user with a default movie.\nState is defined and transforms by a reducer function. Let&#x2019;s create a watchlist reducer:\ncd watchlist/reducers\nng g reducer WatchlistData --reducers index.ts\nOpen the generated file watchlist-data.reducer.ts. You see three exports: The State interface defines the shape of the state. There is only one instance of a feature state in the store at all times. The initialState constant is the state at application creation time. The reducer function will later be called by the store to produce the next state instance based on the current state and an action object.\nLet&#x2019;s put a movie into the user&#x2019;s watchlist:\nwatchlist-data.reducer.ts\nexport interface State {\nitems: WatchlistItem[];\n}\nexport const initialState: State = {\nitems: [\n{\nid: 42,\nmovie: {\nid: 1,\ntitle: &apos;Die Hard&apos;,\ngenre: &apos;action&apos;,\nreleaseYear: 1988,\nruntimeMinutes: 132\n},\nplaybackMinutes: 0,\nadded: new Date(),\n}\n]\n};\nSelect the current watchlist\nState slices can be retrieved from the store using selectors.\nCreate a watchlist component:\nng g c watchlist/Watchlist\nand add it to the exports of WatchlistModule. Also, replace app.component.html with\n&lt;app-watchlist&gt;&lt;/app-watchlist&gt;\nState observables are obtained using selectors. They are memoized by default, meaning that you don&#x2019;t have to worry about performance if you use complicated calculations when deriving state&#x2009;&#x2014;&#x2009;these are only performed once per state emission.\nAdd a selector to watchlist-data.reducer.ts:\nexport const getAllItems = (state: State) =&gt; state.items;\nNext, we have to re-export the selector for this substate in the feature reducer. Modify the watchlist/reducers/index.ts like this:\nwatchlist/reducers/index.ts\nimport {\nActionReducer,\nActionReducerMap,\ncreateFeatureSelector,\ncreateSelector,\nMetaReducer\n} from &apos;@ngrx/store&apos;;\nimport { environment } from &apos;src/environments/environment&apos;;\nimport * as fromWatchlistData from &apos;./watchlist-data.reducer&apos;;\nimport * as fromRoot from &apos;src/app/reducers/index&apos;;\nexport interface WatchlistState { (1)\nwatchlistData: fromWatchlistData.State;\n}\nexport interface State extends fromRoot.State { (2)\nwatchlist: WatchlistState;\n}\nexport const reducers: ActionReducerMap&lt;WatchlistState&gt; = { (3)\nwatchlistData: fromWatchlistData.reducer,\n};\nexport const metaReducers: MetaReducer&lt;WatchlistState&gt;[] = !environment.production ? [] : [];\nexport const getFeature = createFeatureSelector&lt;State, WatchlistState&gt;(&apos;watchlist&apos;); (4)\nexport const getWatchlistData = createSelector( (5)\ngetFeature,\nstate =&gt; state.watchlistData\n);\nexport const getAllItems = createSelector( (6)\ngetWatchlistData,\nfromWatchlistData.getAllItems\n);\nThe feature state, each member is managed by a different reducer\nFeature states are registered by the forFeature method. This interface provides a typesafe path from root to feature state.\nTie substates of a feature state to the corresponding reducers\nCreate a selector to access the &apos;watchlist&apos; feature state\nselect the watchlistData sub state\nre-export the selector\nNote how createSelector allows to chain selectors. This is a powerful tool that also allows for selecting from multiple states.\nYou can use selectors as pipeable operators:\nwatchlist.component.ts\nexport class WatchlistComponent {\nwatchlistItems$: Observable&lt;WatchlistItem[]&gt;;\nconstructor(\nprivate store: Store&lt;fromWatchlist.State&gt;\n) {\nthis.watchlistItems$ = this.store.pipe(select(fromWatchlist.getAllItems));\n}\n}\nwatchlist.component.html\n&lt;h1&gt;Watchlist&lt;/h1&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li *ngFor=&quot;let item of watchlistItems$ | async&quot;&gt;{{item.movie.title}} ({{item.movie.releaseYear}}): {{item.playbackMinutes}}/{{item.movie.runtimeMinutes}} min watched&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\nDispatching an action to update watched minutes\nWe track the user&#x2019;s current progress at watching a movie as the playbackMinutes property. After closing a video, the watched minutes have to be updated. In NgRx, state is being updated by dispatching actions. An action is an option with a (globally unique) type discriminator and an optional payload.\nCreating the action\nCreate a file playback/actions/index.ts. In this example, we do not further separate the actions per sub state. Actions can be defined by using action creators:\nplayback/actions/index.ts\nimport { createAction, props, union } from &apos;@ngrx/store&apos;;\nexport const playbackFinished = createAction(&apos;[Playback] Playback finished&apos;, props&lt;{ movieId: number, stoppedAtMinute: number }&gt;());\nconst actions = union({\nplaybackFinished\n});\nexport type ActionsUnion = typeof actions;\nFirst we specify the type, followed by a call to the payload definition function. Next, we create a union of all possible actions for this file using union, which allows us a to access action payloads in the reducer in a typesafe way.\nTip\nAction types should follow the naming convention [Source] Event, e.g. [Recommended List] Hide Recommendation or [Auth API] Login Success. Think of actions rather as events than commands. You should never use the same action at two different places (you can still handle multiple actions the same way). This faciliates tracing the source of an action. For details see Good Action Hygiene with NgRx by Mike Ryan (video).\nDispatch\nWe skip the implementation of an actual video playback page and simulate wathcing a movie in 10 minute segments by adding a link in the template:\nwatchlist-component.html\n&lt;li *ngFor=&quot;let item of watchlistItems$ | async&quot;&gt;... &lt;button (click)=&quot;stoppedPlayback(item.movie.id, item.playbackMinutes + 10)&quot;&gt;Add 10 Minutes&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\nwatchlist-component.ts\nimport * as playbackActions from &apos;src/app/playback/actions&apos;;\n...\nstoppedPlayback(movieId: number, stoppedAtMinute: number) {\nthis.store.dispatch(playbackActions.playbackFinished({ movieId, stoppedAtMinute }));\n}\nState reduction\nNext, we handle the action inside the watchlistData reducer. Note that actions can be handled by multiple reducers and effects at the same time to update different states, for example if we&#x2019;d like to show a rating modal after playback has finished.\nwatchlist-data.reducer.ts\nexport function reducer(state = initialState, action: playbackActions.ActionsUnion): State {\nswitch (action.type) {\ncase playbackActions.playbackFinished.type:\nreturn {\n...state,\nitems: state.items.map(updatePlaybackMinutesMapper(action.movieId, action.stoppedAtMinute))\n};\ndefault:\nreturn state;\n}\n}\nexport function updatePlaybackMinutesMapper(movieId: number, stoppedAtMinute: number) {\nreturn (item: WatchlistItem) =&gt; {\nif (item.movie.id === movieId) {\nreturn {\n...item,\nplaybackMinutes: stoppedAtMinute\n};\n} else {\nreturn item;\n}\n};\n}\nNote how we changed the reducer&#x2019;s function signature to reference the actions union. The switch-case handles all incoming actions to produce the next state. The default case handles all actions a reducer is not interested in by returning the state unchanged. Then we find the watchlist item corresponding to the movie with the given id and update the playback minutes. Since state is immutable, we have to clone all objects down to the one we would like to change using the object spread operator (&#x2026;&#x200B;).\nCaution\nSelectors rely on object identity to decide whether the value has to be recalculated. Do not clone objects that are not on the path to the change you want to make. This is why updatePlaybackMinutesMapper returns the same item if the movie id does not match.\nAlternative state mapping with immer\nIt can be hard to think in immutable changes, especially if your team has a strong background in imperative programming. In this case, you may find the immer library convenient, which allows to produce immutable objects by manipulating a proxied draft. The same reducer can then be written as:\nwatchlist-data.reducer.ts with immer\nimport { produce } from &apos;immer&apos;;\n...\ncase playbackActions.playbackFinished.type:\nreturn produce(state, draft =&gt; {\nconst itemToUpdate = draft.items.find(item =&gt; item.movie.id === action.movieId);\nif (itemToUpdate) {\nitemToUpdate.playbackMinutes = action.stoppedAtMinute;\n}\n});\nImmer works out of the box with plain objects and arrays.\nRedux devtools\nIf the StoreDevToolsModule is instrumented as described above, you can use the browser extension Redux devtools to see all dispatched actions and the resulting state diff, as well as the current state, and even travel back in time by undoing actions.\nFigure 71.

In this example, we consume the actions observable provided by NgRx and listen only for the loadRecommendedMovies actions by using the ofType operator.

Simplifying CRUD with NgRx/Entity\nMost of the time when manipulating entries in the store, we like to create, add, update, or delete entries (CRUD). NgRx/Entity provides convenience functions if each item of a collection has an id property. Luckily all our entities already have this property.\nLet&#x2019;s add functionality to add a movie to the watchlist. First, create the required action:\nrecommendation/actions/index.ts\nexport const addToWatchlist = createAction(&apos;[Recommendation List] Add to watchlist&apos;,\nprops&lt;{ watchlistItemId: number, movie: Movie, addedAt: Date }&gt;());\nNote\nYou may wonder why the Date object is not created inside the reducer instead, since it should always be the current time. However, remember that reducers should be deterministic state machines&#x2009;&#x2014;&#x2009;State A + Action B should always result in the same State C.

The indentation with must be 2 spaces.\nWhite space\nIn order to improve the readability of your code, you must introduce whitespaces. Example:\nif(condition){\nmust be\nif (condition) {\nNaming conventions\nFile naming\nThe file name must follow the pattern: (name in kebap case).(kind of component).(extension)\nThe test file name must follow the pattern: (name in kebap case).(kind of component).spec.(extension)\nExample:\nauth-jwt.service.ts\nauth-jwt.service.spec.ts\nInterface naming\nThe interface names must be in pascal case, and must start with I. There is some controversy in starting the interface names with an I, but we decided to do it because is most of cases you will have an interface and a class with the same name, so, to differentiate them, we decided to start the interfaces with I. Other devonfw stacks solves it by adding the suffix Impl in the class implementations.\nExample:\ninterface ICoffee {}\nClass naming\nThe class names must be in pascal case.\nExample:\nclass Coffee {}\nVariable naming\nAll variable names must be in camel case.\nconst coffeeList: Coffe[];\nDeclarations\nFor all variable declarations we must use const or let. var is forbidden. We preffer to use const when possible.\nProgramming practices\nTrailing comma\nAll statements must end with a trailing comma. Example:\n{\none: &apos;one&apos;,\ntwo: &apos;two&apos; // bad\n}\n{\none: &apos;one&apos;,\ntwo: &apos;two&apos;, // good\n}\nArrow functions\nAll anonymous functions must be definned with the arrow function notation. In most of cases it&#x2019;s not a problem, but sometimes, when you do not want to bind this when you define the function, you can use the other function definition. In this special cases you must disable the linter for those sentence.\nComments\nComments must start with a whitespace. Example:\n//This is a bad comment\n// This is OK\nQuotemarks\nFor string definitions, we must use single quotes.\nif statements\nIn all if statements you always must use brackets.

When you define a provider in a module, it can be injected in all components of the module. By default, those providers are only available in the module where it is defined.

If you created your node project using the devon4node application schematic, this file will already exist. If you want to make further adjustments to it, have a look at the ESLint documentation.\nThe ESLint analysis script lint is already configured in the scripts part of your package.json. Simply add -f json &gt; report.json, so that the output of the analysis is saved in a .json file. Additional information to customization options for the ESLint CLI can be found here.\nTo run the analysis, execute the script with npm run lint inside the base directory of your project.\nConfiguring SonarQube\nIf you haven&#x2019;t already generated your CICD-related files, follow the tutorial on the devon4node schematic of our CICDGEN project, as you will need a Jenkinsfile configured in your project to proceed.\nInside the script for the SonarQube code analysis in your Jenkinsfile, add the parameter -Dsonar.eslint.reportPaths=report.json.

Press Create\nStep 2.4: Copy the oc commands in case it is required to work via command line, and Go to overview\nStep 2.5: Wait until OpenShift deploys and starts up the image. All the info will be available.\nPlease notice that there are no pre-configured routes, hence the application is not accessible from outside the cluster.\nStep 3: Create a route in order for the application to be accessible from outside the cluster (external traffic). Press Create\nPlease notice that there are different fields that can be specified (hostname, port). If required, the value of those fields can be modified later.\nLeave by the moment the default config. as it is enough for the basic setup.\nThe route for external traffic is now available.\nNow the BitBucker server container is up &amp; running in our cluster.\nThe below steps correspond to the basic configuration of our BitBucket server.\nStep 4.1: Click on the link of the external traffic route. This will open our BitBucket server setup wizard\nStep 4.2: Leave by the moment the Internal database since it is enough for the basic setup (and it can be modified later), and click Next\nStep 4.3: Select the evaluation license, and click I have an account\nStep 4.4: Select the option Bitbucker (Server)\nStep 4.5: Introduce your organization (Capgemini), and click Generate License\nStep 4.6: Confirm that you want to install the license on the BitBucket server\nThe license key will be automatically generated. Click Next\nStep 4.7: Introduce the details of the Administration account.\nSince our BitBucket server is not going to be integrated with JIRA, click on Go to Bitbucket. The integration with JIRA can be configured later.\nStep 4.8: Log in with the admin account that has been just created\nDONE !!\n[Under construction]\nThe purpose of the present document is to provide the basic steps carried out to improve the configuration of BitBucket server in OpenShift.\nThe improved configuration consists on:\nPersistent Volume Claims\nHealth Checks (pending to be completed)\nPersistent Volume Claims.\nPlease notice that the BitBucket server container does not use persistent volume claims by default, which means that the data (e.g.: BitBucket server config.) will be lost from one deployment to another.\nIt is very important to create a persistent volume claim in order to prevent the mentioned loss of data.\nStep 1: Add storage\nStep 2: Select the appropriate storage, or create it from scratch if necessary\nStep 3: Introduce the required information\nPath as it is specified in the BitBucket server Docker image (/var/atlassian/application-data/bitbucket)\nVolume name with a unique name to clearly identify the volume\nThe change will be inmediately applied\n"},{"id":843,"path":"../..\\..\\..\\..\\..\\xampp\\htdocs\\devonfw.github.io\\website\\pages\\docs/master-devonfw-shop-floor.asciidoc_annexes.html#master-devonfw-shop-floor.asciidoc_selenium-basic-grid","type":"docs","title":"Selenium Basic Grid","body":"60.2.

Basic Selenium Grid setup in OpenShift\n[Under construction]\nThe purpose of the present document is to provide the basic steps carried out to setup a Selenium Grid (Hub + Nodes) in OpenShift.\nIntroduction\nSelenium is a tool to automate web browser across many platforms. It allows the automation of the testing in many different browsers, operating systems, programing laguages, or testing frameworks. (for further information pelase see Selenium)\nSelenium Grid is the platform provided by Selenium in order to perform the execution of tests in parallel and in a distributed way.\nIt basically consists on a Selenium Server (also known as hub or simply server) which redirects the requests it receives to the appropriate node (Firefox node, Chrome node, &#x2026;&#x200B;) depending on how the Selenium WebDriver is configured or implemented (See Selenium Doc.)\nAdditional documentacion:\nhttps://www.tutorialspoint.com/selenium/selenium_grids.htm\nhttp://www.softwaretestinghelp.com/selenium-ide-download-and-installation-selenium-tutorial-2\nhttps://examples.javacodegeeks.com/enterprise-java/selenium/selenium-standalone-server-example\nhttps://tripleqa.com/2016/09/26/hello-world-selenium\nhttp://queirozf.com/entries/selenium-hello-world-style-tutorial\nPrerequisites\nOpenShift up &amp; running\nProcedure\nThe present procedure is divided into two different main parts:\n* First part: Selenium Hub (server) installation\n* Second part: Selenium node installation (Firefox &amp; Chrome)\n* Create persistent volumes for the hub and the node(s)\nSelenium Hub installation\nThe followed approach consists on deploying new image from the OpenShift WenConsole.\nThe image as well as its documentation and details can be found at Selenium Hub Docker Image\nStep 1: Deploy Image\nStep 2: Image Name\nAs it is specified in the documentation (selenium/hub)\n(Please notice that, as it is described in the additional documentation of the above links, the server will run by default on 4444 port)\nStep 3: Introduce the appropriate resource name\n(selenium-hub in this case)\n(No additional config. is required by the moment)\nOnce the image is deployed, you will be able to check &amp; review the config. of the container. Please notice by, by default, no route is created for external traffic, hence the application (the selenium server or hub) is not reachable from outside the cluster\nStep 4: Create a route for external traffic\nStep 5: Change the default config. if necessary\nDONE !!\nThe Selenium Server is now accesible from outside the cluster. Click on the link of the route and you will be able to see the server home page.\nconsole/view config to see the default server config.\nPlease notice that the server is not detecting any node up &amp; running, since we have not yet installed none of them.\nSelenium Node Firefox installation\n(Same steps apply for Selenium Node Chrome with the selenium/node-chrome Docker image)\nThe key point of the nodes installation is to specify the host name and port of the hub. If this step is not correctly done, the container will be setup but the application will not run.\nThe followed approach consists on deploying new image from the OpenShift WenConsole.\nThe image as well as its documentation and details can be found at Selenium Hub Docker Image (firefox node in this case)\nStep 1: Deploy Image\nIntroduce the appropriate Docker Image name as it is specified in the documentation (selenium/node-firefox)\nStep 2: Introduce the appropriate resource name\n(selenium-node-firefox in this case)\nStep 3: Introduce, as environment variables, the host name and port of the selenium hub previously created\nEnv. var. for selenium hub host name\nName: HUB_PORT_4444_TCP_ADDR\nValue: The Selenium hub host name. It&#x2019;s recommended to use the service name of the internal OpenShift service.\nEnv. var. for host selenium hub host port\nName: HUB_PORT_4444_TCP_PORT\nValue: 4444 (by default), or the appropriate one if it was changed during the installation.\nDONE !!\nIf the creation of the container was correct, we will be able to see our new selenium-node-firefox application up &amp; running, as well as we will be able to see that the firefox node has correctly detected the selenium hub (in the log of the POD)\nIf we go back to the configuration of the SeleniumHub through the WebConsole, we also will be able to see the our new firefox node\nPersistent Volumes\nLast part of the installation of the Selenium Grid consists on creating persistent volumes for both, the hub container and the node container.\nPersistent Volumes can be easely created folling the the BitBucket Extra server configuration\n"},{"id":845,"path":"../..\\..\\..\\..\\..\\xampp\\htdocs\\devonfw.github.io\\website\\pages\\docs/master-devonfw-shop-floor.asciidoc_annexes.html#master-devonfw-shop-floor.asciidoc_mirabaud-experience","type":"docs","title":"Mirabaud Experience","body":"60.3.

Jenkins - GitLab integration\nThe first step to have a Continuous Integration system for your development is to make sure that all your changes to your team&#x2019;s remote repository are evaluated by the time they are pushed. That usually implies the usage of so-called webhooks. You&#x2019;ll find a fancy explanation about what Webhooks are in here.\nTo resume what we&#x2019;re doing here, we are going to prepare our Jenkins and our GitLab so when a developer pushes some changes to the GitLab repository, a pipeline in Jenkins gets triggered. Just like that, in an automatic way.\n1. Jenkins GitLab plugin\nAs it usually happens, some Jenkins plug-in(s) must be installed. In this case, let&#x2019;s install those related with GitLab:\n2. GitLab API Token\nTo communicate with GitLab from Jenkins, we will need to create an authentication token from your GitLab user settings. A good practice for this would be to create it from a machine user. Something like (i.e.) devonfw-ci/******.\nSimply by adding a name to it and a date for it expire is enough:\nAs GitLab said, you should make sure you don&#x2019;t lose your token. Otherwise you would need to create a new one.\nThis will allow Jenkins to connect with right permissions to our GitLab server.\n3. Create &quot;GitLab API&quot; Token credentials\nThose credentials will use that token already generated in GitLab to connect once we declare the GitLab server in the Global Jenkins configuration. Obviously, those credentials must be GitLab API token-like.\nThen, we add the generated token in the API token field:\nLook in your Global credentials if they had been correctly created:\n4. Create GitLab connection in Jenkins\nSpecify a GitLab connection in your Jenkins&#x2019;s Manage Jenkins &gt; Configure System configuration. This will tell Jenkins where is our GitLab server, a user to access it from and so on.\nYou&#x2019;ll need to give it a name, for example, related with what this GitLab is dedicated for (specific clients, internal projects&#x2026;&#x200B;). Then, the Gitlab host URL is just where your GitLab server is. If you have it locally, that field should look similar to:\nConnection name: my-local-gitlab\nGitlab host URL: http://localhost:${PORT_NUMBER}\nFinally, we select our recently GitLab API token as credentials.\n5. Jenkins Pipeline changes\n5.1 Choose GitLab connection in Pipeline&#x2019;s General configuration\nFirst, our pipeline should allow us to add a GitLab connection to connect to (the already created one).\nIn the case of the local example, could be like this:\nGitLab connection: my-local-gitlab\nGitLab Repository Name: myusername/webhook-test (for example)\n5.2 Create a Build Trigger\nYou should already see your GitLab project&#x2019;s URL (as you stated in the General settings of the Pipeline).\nWrite .*build.* in the comment for triggering a build\nSpecify or filter the branch of your repo you want use as target. That means, whenever a git action is done to that branch (for example, master), this Pipeline is going to be built.\nGenerate a Secret token (to be added in the yet-to-be-created GitLab webhook).\n6. GitLab Webhook\nGo to you GitLab project&#x2019;s Settings &gt; Integration section.\nAdd the path to your Jenkins Pipeline. Make sure you add project instead of job in the path.\nPaste the generated Secret token of your Jenkins pipeline\nSelect your git action that will trigger the build.\n7. Results\nAfter all those steps you should have a result similar to this in your Pipeline:\nEnjoy the Continuous Integration! :)\n"},{"id":848,"path":"../..\\..\\..\\..\\..\\xampp\\htdocs\\devonfw.github.io\\website\\pages\\docs/master-devonfw-shop-floor.asciidoc_annexes.html#dsf-mirabaud-jenkins-nexus-integration.asciidoc","type":"docs","title":"Jenkins - Nexus integration","body":"60.3.3.

Jenkins - SonarQube integration\nFirst thing is installing both tools by, for example, Docker or Docker Compose. Then, we have to think about how they should collaborate to create a more efficient Continuous Integration process.\nOnce our project&#x2019;s pipeline is triggered (it could also be triggered in a fancy way, such as when a merge to the develop branch is done).\n1. Jenkins SonarQube plugin\nTypically in those integration cases, Jenkins plug-in installations become a must. Let&#x2019;s look for some available SonarQube plug-in(s) for Jenkins:\n2. SonarQube token\nOnce installed let&#x2019;s create a token in SonarQube so that Jenkins can communicate with it to trigger their Jobs. Once we install SonarQube in our CI/CD machine (ideally a remote machine) let&#x2019;s login with admin/admin credentials:\nAfterwards, SonarQube itself asks you to create this token we talked about (the name is up to you):\nThen a token is generated:\nYou click in &quot;continue&quot; and the token&#x2019;s generation is completed:\n3. Jenkins SonarQube Server setup\nNow we need to tell Jenkins where is SonarQube and how to communicate with it. In Manage Jenkins &gt; Configure Settings. We add a name for the server (up to you), where it is located (URL), version and the Server authentication token created in point 2.\n4. Jenkins SonarQube Scanner\nInstall a SonarQube Scanner as a Global tool in Jenkins to be used in the project&#x2019;s pipeline.\n5. Pipeline code\nLast step is to add the SonarQube process in our project&#x2019;s Jenkins pipeline. The following code will trigger a SonarQube process that will evaluate our code&#x2019;s quality looking for bugs, duplications, and so on.\nstage &apos;SonarQube Analysis&apos;\ndef scannerHome = tool &apos;SonarQube scanner&apos;;\nsh &quot;${scannerHome}/bin/sonar-scanner \\\n-Dsonar.host.url=http://url-to-your-sq-server:9000/ \\\n-Dsonar.login=[SONAR_USER] -Dsonar.password=[SONAR_PASS] \\\n-Dsonar.projectKey=[PROJECT_KEY] \\\n-Dsonar.projectName=[PROJECT_NAME] -Dsonar.projectVersion=[PROJECT_VERSION] \\\n-Dsonar.sources=. -Dsonar.java.binaries=. \\\n-Dsonar.java.source=1.8 -Dsonar.language=java&quot;\n6. Results\nAfter all this, you should end up having something like this in Jenkins:\nAnd in SonarQube:\n7. Changes in a devonfw project to execute SonarQube tests with Coverage\nThe plugin used to have Coverage reports in the SonarQube for devonfw projects is Jacoco. There are some changes in the project&#x2019;s parent pom.xml that are mandatory to use it.\nInside of the &lt;properties&gt; tag:\n&lt;properties&gt;\n(...)\n&lt;sonar.jacoco.version&gt;3.8&lt;/sonar.jacoco.version&gt;\n&lt;sonar.java.coveragePlugin&gt;jacoco&lt;/sonar.java.coveragePlugin&gt;\n&lt;sonar.core.codeCoveragePlugin&gt;jacoco&lt;/sonar.core.codeCoveragePlugin&gt;\n&lt;sonar.dynamicAnalysis&gt;reuseReports&lt;/sonar.dynamicAnalysis&gt;\n&lt;sonar.language&gt;java&lt;/sonar.language&gt;\n&lt;sonar.java.source&gt;1.7&lt;/sonar.java.source&gt;\n&lt;sonar.junit.reportPaths&gt;target/surefire-reports&lt;/sonar.junit.reportPaths&gt;\n&lt;sonar.jacoco.reportPaths&gt;target/jacoco.exec&lt;/sonar.jacoco.reportPaths&gt;\n&lt;sonar.sourceEncoding&gt;UTF-8&lt;/sonar.sourceEncoding&gt;\n&lt;sonar.exclusions&gt;\n**/generated-sources/**/*,\n**io/oasp/mirabaud/general/**/*,\n**/*Dao.java,\n**/*Entity.java,\n**/*Cto.java,\n**/*Eto.java,\n**/*SearchCriteriaTo.java,\n**/*management.java,\n**/*SpringBootApp.java,\n**/*SpringBootBatchApp.java,\n**/*.xml,\n**/*.jsp\n&lt;/sonar.exclusions&gt;\n&lt;sonar.coverage.exclusions&gt;\n**io/oasp/mirabaud/general/**/*,\n**/*Dao.java,\n**/*Entity.java,\n**/*Cto.java,\n**/*Eto.java,\n**/*SearchCriteriaTo.java,\n**/*management.java,\n**/*SpringBootApp.java,\n**/*SpringBootBatchApp.java,\n**/*.xml,\n**/*.jsp\n&lt;/sonar.coverage.exclusions&gt;\n&lt;sonar.host.url&gt;http://${YOUR_SONAR_SERVER_URL}/&lt;/sonar.host.url&gt;\n&lt;jacoco.version&gt;0.7.9&lt;/jacoco.version&gt;\n&lt;war.plugin.version&gt;3.2.0&lt;/war.plugin.version&gt;\n&lt;assembly.plugin.version&gt;3.1.0&lt;/assembly.plugin.version&gt;\n&lt;/properties&gt;\nOf

ISTIO Service Mesh Implementation Guide\nIntroduction\nA service mesh separating applications from network functions like resilience, fault tolerance, etc,.\nA service mesh addresses the below functions without changing the application code.\nTest the new versions of services without impacting the users.\nScale the services.\nFind the services with the help of service registry.\nTest against failures.\nSecure service-to-service communication.\nRoute traffic to a specific way.\nCircuit breaking and fault injection.\nMonitor the services and collect matrices.\nTracing.\nISTIO service mesh is an open environment for Connecting, Securing, Monitoring services across the environments.\nISTIO Architecture\nISTIO is split into data plane and control plane. Refer ISTIO Architecture\nData Plane\nThe data plane is a set of intelligent proxies (Envoy) deployed as sidecars that mediate and control all network communication among microservices.\nControl Plane\nThe control plane is managing and configuring proxies to route traffic and enforcing policies.\nPilot manages all the proxies and responsible for routing\nMixer collects telemetry and policy check\nCitadel does Certificate management (TLS certs to Envoys)\nISTIO installation\nDownload ISTIO from releases\nistioctl install --set profile=demo\nHere used demo profile, there are other profiles for production.\nVerify installation:\nkubectl get all -n istio-system\nInject sidecar container automatically by issuing the below command.\nkubectl label namespace default istio-injection=enabled\nVerify:\nkubectl get namespace -L istio-injection\nFor more installation guides, refer ISTIO Installation\nTraffic Management\nISITO&#x2019;s traffic management model relies on the Envoy proxies which deployed as sidecars to services.\nBelow are the traffic management API resources\nVirtual Services\nDestination Rules\nGateways\nService Entries\nSidecars\nA virtual service, higher level abstraction of Kubernetes Service, lets you configure how requests are routed to a service within an Istio service mesh. Your mesh may have multiple virtual services or none. Virtual service consists of routing rules that are evaluated in order.\nDark Launch\nThe following virtual service routes requests to different versions of a service depending on whether the request comes from a testuser. If the testuser calls then version v1 will be used, and for others version v2.\nBlue/Green deployment\nIn blue/green deployment two versions of the application running. Both versions are live on different domain names, in this example it is mtsj.com and test.mtsj.com.\nDefine 2 virtual services for mtsj v1 and v2 versions.\nDefine DestinationRule and configure the subsets for v1 and v2.\nWhen end user browses mtsj.com, the gateway call goes to subset v1 of the virtual service and redirects to destination version v1, and for test.mtsj.com to version v2.\nCanary Deployment (Traffic Splitting)\nIn canary deployment old and new versions of the application alive. ISTIO can be configured, how much percentage of traffic can go to each version.\nHere, the traffic is divided 75% to the version V1, and 25% to the version V2, as we gain confidence the percentage can be increased the latest version and gradually the traffic to the old version can be reduced and removed.\nYou may refer ISTIO Traffic Management for more details.\nMyThaiStar Implementation\nIn this example dish will have two versions and the traffic will be routed alternately using the ISTIO configuration.\nFind all configuration files in istio/trafficmanagement/canary directory under mythaistarmicroservices example.\nMyThaiStar defines below\nService\nService Account\nDeployment\nThe above configurations are defined in a single yaml file for all the different services like angular, dish, image etc.\ndish-v2: Dish Version 2 can be kept separately in different yaml file.\nmts-gateway defines the ingress gateway which routes the outbound request to each service.\ndestination-rule-all defines the subsets here for later traffic routing\ndish-50-50: traffic routing for different versions of dishmanagement.\nNetwork Resilience\nTimeout\nIstio lets you adjust the timeouts using virtual services. The default timeout is 15 seconds.\nRetry\nA retry setting specifies the maximum number of times an Envoy proxy attempts to connect to a service if the initial call fails.\nRetries can also be configured on Gateway Error, Connection failure, Connection Refused or any 5xx error from the application.\nretryOn: gateway-error,connect-failure,refused-stream,5xx\nCircuit Breakers\nBy defining the destination rule, set limits for calls to individual hosts within a service, such as the number of concurrent connections or how many times calls to this host have failed once the limit reached.\nOutlier Detection is an ISTIO Resiliency strategy to detect unusual host behaviour and evict the unhealthy hosts from the set of load balanced healthy hosts inside a cluster.\nIf a request is sent to a service instance and it fails (returns a 50X error code), then ISTIO ejects the instance from the load balanced pool for a specified duration.\nFault Injection\nTwo types of faults can be generated using ISTIO. This is useful for the testing.\nDelays: timing failures.\nAborts: crash failures.\nBelow example is a crash failure Virtual Service. The below example configured to receive http status 500 error for the testuser. The application works fine for all other users.\nThe below virtual service configured to wait 10s for all requests.\nSecurity\nISTIO provides security solution has the below functions.\nTraffic encryption\nMutual TLS and fine-grained access policies.\nAuditing tools\nAuthentication\nISTIO provides two types of authentication.\nPeer authentication, secures service to service authentication\nRequest authentication is end user authentication to verify credential attached to the request.\nMutual TLS Authentication\nBy default, the TLS protocol only proves the identity of the server to the client. Mutual TLS authentication ensures that traffic has been traffic is secure and trusted in both the directions between the client and server.\nAll traffic between services with proxies uses mutual TLS by default.\nPeer Authentication\nPeer authentication has Permissive, Strict and Disabled mode. With permissive mode, a service accepts both plain text and mutual TLS traffic. Permissive mode is good at the time of onboarding and should switch to Strict later.\nThe authentication policy can be applied to mesh-wide, namespace wide or workload specific using the selector field.\nHere the policy applied to the workload bookings.\nCheck the default mesh policy:\nkubectl describe meshpolicy default\nRequest authentication\nRequest authentication policies specify the values needed to validate JWT tokens.\nAuthentication\nApplies to\nUses\nIdentity\nPeer authentication\nService to service\nmTLS\nsource.principal\nRequest authentication\nEnd User authentication\nJWT\nrequest.auth.principal\nAuthorization\nApply an authorization policy to the workload/namespace/mesh to enforce the access control. Supports ALLOW and DENY actions.\nDeny All\nBelow example authorization policy without any rules denies access to all workloads in admin namespace.\nExample below allowing the GET methods from order service.\nExample below denies the request to the /registered path for requests without request principals.\nYou may refer ISTIO Security for more details.\nObservability\nISTIO generates\nMetrics - for monitor latency, traffic, errors and saturation.\nDistributed Traces to identify call flows and service dependencies\nAccess Logs enables audit service behaviour to the individual service level.\nGrafana dashboard\nGrafana and Prometheus are preconfigured addons on ISTIO. To enable, choose the configuration profile which has Prometheus and Grafana enabled. Eg: Demo profile\nVerify Prometheus and Grafana running in the cluster.\nkubectl get pods -n istio-system\nKiali dashboard\nThe Kiali dashboard helps you understand the structure of your service mesh by displaying the topology. The demo profile enables Kiali dashboard also.\nAccess the Kiali dashboard. The default user name is admin and default password is admin.\nistioctl dashboard kiali\nYou may refer ISTIO Observability\nMinikube Troubleshooting Tips\nThis documentation provides the troubleshooting tips while working with minikube in a local machine.\nAlways start minikube with a minimum of 4GB of memory or more if available. Using command minikube start --memory=4096\nIf minikube is not starting or throwing any error even after multiple attempts. Try the below tips:\nDelete the minikube in your local machine using minikube delete and do a fresh minikube start.\nIn any case, if minikube is not starting even after the above step, go to .minikube folder under the users directory and delete it manually. Now try starting minikube.\nSet docker environment in minikube using minikube docker-env. Now all the docker commands that are run will be on the docker inside minikube. So building your application after executing the above command will have the application docker images available to minikube.\nTo exit minikube docker environment use minikube docker-env -u\nIn any case, if you face any error related to docker image such as Failed to pull image, or image not found errors we will have to manually push the application docker image to minikube docker cache using the below commands.\nFor better results - stop minikube using minikube stop command.\nExecute the command minikube cache add imageName/tagName.\nNow start the minikube. To verify if the docker image has been added to minikube docker execute minikube ssh docker images.\nTo remove any docker image from minikube docker stop any containers running that docker image and then execute minikube cache delete imageName/tagName.\nTo reload any docker image to minikube docker environment, execute minikube cache reload.\nIn any case, if the docker images are not getting removed from minikube docker environment then navigate to .minikube/cache/images and then delete the particular image.\nExecute the below command to make the Grafana available.\nkubectl -n istio-system port-forward $(kubectl -n istio-system get pod -l app=grafana -o jsonpath=&apos;\\{.items[0].metadata.name}&apos;) 3000:3000 &amp;\nUse the below URLs to view the dashboard in local machine.\nhttp://localhost:3000/dashboard/db/istio-mesh-dashboard\n&#x2190;&#xA0;Previous:&#xA0;Monitoring&#xA0;| &#x2191;&#xA0;Up:&#xA0;devonfw shop floor&#xA0;| &#x2302;&#xA0;Home:&#xA0;devonfw guide&#xA0;| Next:&#xA0;cicdgen&#xA0;&#x2192;\n"},{"id":869,"path":"../..\\..\\..\\..\\..\\xampp\\htdocs\\devonfw.github.io\\website\\pages\\docs/master-devonfw-shop-floor.asciidoc_configuration-and-services-integration.html#master-devonfw-shop-floor.asciidoc_configuration-and-services-integration","type":"docs","title":"Configuration and services integration","body":"56.

If you are going to create a ci/cd for a new branch or you are going to modify something, be very careful with everything that this first step declares.\nThis is an example of this stage:\nscript {\ntool yarn\ntool Chrome-stable\ntool dockerTool\nif (env.BRANCH_NAME.startsWith(&apos;release&apos;)) {\ndockerTag = &quot;release&quot;\nrepositoryName = &apos;maven-releases&apos;\ndockerEnvironment = &quot;_uat&quot;\nopenShiftNamespace += &quot;-uat&quot;\nsonarProjectKey = &apos;-release&apos;\n}\nif (env.BRANCH_NAME == &apos;develop&apos;) {\ndockerTag = &quot;latest&quot;\nrepositoryName = &apos;maven-snapshots&apos;\ndockerEnvironment = &quot;_dev&quot;\nopenShiftNamespace += &quot;-dev&quot;\nsonarProjectKey = &apos;-develop&apos;\n}\nif (env.BRANCH_NAME == &apos;master&apos;) {\ndockerTag = &quot;production&quot;\nrepositoryName = &apos;maven-releases&apos;\ndockerEnvironment = &apos;_prod&apos;\nopenShiftNamespace += &quot;-prod&quot;\nsonarProjectKey = &apos;&apos;\n}\nsh &quot;yarn&quot;\n}\nCode lint analysis\nThe next stage is to analyze the code making a lint analysis. To do it your project should have a tslint file with the configuration (tslint.json).\nanalyzing the code in your pipeline is as simple as executing the following command:\nsh &quot;&quot;&quot;yarn lint&quot;&quot;&quot;\nNote\nYour project need to have an script with tslint configuration (tslint.json).\nExecute tests\nTo test you application first of all your application should have created the tests and you should use one of the next two options:\nExecute test with maven (It should be used by devon4j).\nwithMaven(globalMavenSettingsConfig: globalSettingsId, maven: mavenInstallation) {\nsh &quot;mvn clean test&quot;\n}\nExecute test with yarn (It should be used by devon4ng or devon4node).\nsh &quot;&quot;&quot;yarn test:ci&quot;&quot;&quot;\nNote\nRemember that your project should have the tests created and in case of do it with yarn or npm, you package.json should have the script declared. This is an example &quot;test:ci&quot;: &quot;ng test --browsers ChromeHeadless --watch=false&quot;.\nSonarQube Analisys\nIt is time to see if your application complies the requirements of the sonar analysis.\nTo do it you could use one of the next two options:\nExecute Sonar with sonarTool (It should be used by devon4ng or devon4node).\nscript {\ndef scannerHome = tool sonarTool\ndef props = readJSON file: &apos;package.json&apos;\nwithSonarQubeEnv(sonarEnv) {\nsh &quot;&quot;&quot;\n${scannerHome}/bin/sonar-scanner \\\n-Dsonar.projectKey=${props.name}${sonarProjectKey} \\\n-Dsonar.projectName=${props.name}${sonarProjectKey} \\\n-Dsonar.projectVersion=${props.version} \\\n-Dsonar.sources=${srcDir} \\\n-Dsonar.typescript.lcov.reportPaths=coverage/lcov.info\n&quot;&quot;&quot;\n}\ntimeout(time: 1, unit: &apos;HOURS&apos;) {\ndef qg = waitForQualityGate()\nif (qg.status != &apos;OK&apos;) {\nerror &quot;Pipeline aborted due to quality gate failure: ${qg.status}&quot;\n}\n}\n}\nExecute Sonar with maven (It should be used by devon4j).\nscript {\nwithMaven(globalMavenSettingsConfig: globalSettingsId, maven: mavenInstallation) {\nwithSonarQubeEnv(sonarEnv) {\n// Change the project name (in order to simulate branches with the free version)\nsh &quot;cp pom.xml pom.xml.bak&quot;\nsh &quot;cp api/pom.xml api/pom.xml.bak&quot;\nsh &quot;cp core/pom.xml core/pom.xml.bak&quot;\nsh &quot;cp server/pom.xml server/pom.xml.bak&quot;\ndef pom = readMavenPom file: &apos;./pom.xml&apos;;\npom.artifactId = &quot;${pom.artifactId}${sonarProjectKey}&quot;\nwriteMavenPom model: pom, file: &apos;pom.xml&apos;\ndef apiPom = readMavenPom file: &apos;api/pom.xml&apos;\napiPom.parent.artifactId = pom.artifactId\napiPom.artifactId = &quot;${pom.artifactId}-api&quot;\nwriteMavenPom model: apiPom, file: &apos;api/pom.xml&apos;\ndef corePom = readMavenPom file: &apos;core/pom.xml&apos;\ncorePom.parent.artifactId = pom.artifactId\ncorePom.artifactId = &quot;${pom.artifactId}-core&quot;\nwriteMavenPom model: corePom, file: &apos;core/pom.xml&apos;\ndef serverPom = readMavenPom file: &apos;server/pom.xml&apos;\nserverPom.parent.artifactId = pom.artifactId\nserverPom.artifactId = &quot;${pom.artifactId}-server&quot;\nwriteMavenPom model: serverPom, file: &apos;server/pom.xml&apos;\nsh &quot;mvn sonar:sonar&quot;\nsh &quot;mv pom.xml.bak pom.xml&quot;\nsh &quot;mv api/pom.xml.bak api/pom.xml&quot;\nsh &quot;mv core/pom.xml.bak core/pom.xml&quot;\nsh &quot;mv server/pom.xml.bak server/pom.xml&quot;\n}\n}\ntimeout(time: 1, unit: &apos;HOURS&apos;) {\ndef qg = waitForQualityGate()\nif (qg.status != &apos;OK&apos;) {\nerror &quot;Pipeline aborted due to quality gate failure: ${qg.status}&quot;\n}\n}\n}\nBuild\nIf SonarQube is passed, you could build your application. To do it, if you are using devon4ng or devon4node you only need to add the next command:\nsh &quot;&quot;&quot;yarn build&quot;&quot;&quot;\nNote\nIf you are using devon4j this and the next step Store in Nexus are making together using mvn deploy.\nStore in Nexus\nOne time the application has been built the code of the application you could find the artifacts stored in the dist folder. You should push these artifacts to store them in Nexus.\nYou can do it following one of the next options:\nUse maven deploy config of your project (It should be used by devon4j).\nwithMaven(globalMavenSettingsConfig: globalSettingsId, maven: mavenInstallation) {\nsh &quot;mvn deploy -Dmaven.test.skip=true&quot;\n}\nConfigure maven deploy in your pipeline (It should be used by devon4ng and devon4node).\nscript {\ndef props = readJSON file: &apos;package.json&apos;\nzip dir: &apos;dist/&apos;, zipFile: &quot;&quot;&quot;${props.name}.zip&quot;&quot;&quot;\nversion = props.version\nif (!version.endsWith(&quot;-SNAPSHOT&quot;) &amp;&amp; env.BRANCH_NAME == &apos;develop&apos;) {\nversion = &quot;${version}-SNAPSHOT&quot;\nversion = version.replace(&quot;-RC&quot;, &quot;&quot;)\n}\nif (!version.endsWith(&quot;-RC&quot;) &amp;&amp; env.BRANCH_NAME.startsWith(&apos;release&apos;)) {\nversion = &quot;${version}-RC&quot;\nversion = version.replace(&quot;-SNAPSHOT&quot;, &quot;&quot;)\n}\nif (env.BRANCH_NAME == &apos;master&apos; &amp;&amp; (version.endsWith(&quot;-RC&quot;) || version.endsWith(&quot;-SNAPSHOT&quot;))){\nversion = version.replace(&quot;-RC&quot;, &quot;&quot;)\nversion = version.replace(&quot;-SNAPSHOT&quot;, &quot;&quot;)\n}\nwithMaven(globalMavenSettingsConfig: globalSettingsId, maven: mavenInstallation) {\nsh &quot;&quot;&quot;\nmvn deploy:deploy-file \\\n-DgroupId=${groupId} \\\n-DartifactId=${props.name} \\\n-Dversion=${version} \\\n-Dpackaging=zip \\\n-Dfile=${props.name}.zip \\\n-DrepositoryId=${repositoryId} \\\n-Durl=${repositoryUrl}${repositoryName}\n&quot;&quot;&quot;\n}\n}\nCreate docker image\nNow we need to use this artifacts to create a Docker image. To create the docker image you need an external server to do it. You could do it using one of the next:\nCreate docker image using OpenShift cluster\nTo create the docker image with this option you need to configure your OpenShift. You could read how to configure it here.\nprops = readJSON file: &apos;package.json&apos;\nwithCredentials([usernamePassword(credentialsId: &quot;${openShiftCredentials}&quot;, passwordVariable: &apos;pass&apos;, usernameVariable: &apos;user&apos;)]) {\nsh &quot;oc login -u ${user} -p ${pass} ${openshiftUrl} --insecure-skip-tls-verify&quot;\ntry {\nsh &quot;oc start-build ${props.name} --namespace=${openShiftNamespace} --from-dir=dist --wait&quot;\nsh &quot;oc import-image ${props.name} --namespace=${openShiftNamespace} --from=${dockerRegistry}/${props.name}:${dockerTag} --confirm&quot;\n} catch (e) {\nsh &quot;&quot;&quot;\noc logs \\$(oc get builds -l build=${props.name} --namespace=${openShiftNamespace} --sort-by=.metadata.creationTimestamp -o name | tail -n 1) --namespace=${namespace}\nthrow e\n&quot;&quot;&quot;\n}\n}\nNote\nif your project is a maven project you should read the pom.xml file instead of the package.json, you could do it with the next command def pom = readMavenPom file: &apos;pom.xml&apos;. Due to the fact that there are different variable names between those two files, remember to modify ${props.name} for ${pom.artifactId} in the code.\nCreate docker image using docker server\nTo create the docker image with this option you need to install docker and configure where is the docker host in your jenkins.\ndocker.withRegistry(&quot;&quot;&quot;${dockerRegistryProtocol}${dockerRegistry}&quot;&quot;&quot;, dockerRegistryCredentials) {\ndef props = readJSON file: &apos;package.json&apos;\ndef customImage = docker.build(&quot;${props.name}:${props.version}&quot;, &quot;-f ${dockerFileName} .&quot;)\ncustomImage.push()\ncustomImage.push(dockerTag);\n}\nhere\nNote\nif your project is a maven project you should read the pom.xml file instead of the package.json, you could do it with the next command def pom = readMavenPom file: &apos;pom.xml&apos;. Due to the fact that there are different variable names between those two files, remember to modify ${props.name} for ${pom.artifactId} and ${props.version} for ${pom.version} in the code.\nDeploy docker image\nOnce you have the docker image in the registry we only need to import it into your deployment environment. We can do it executing one of the next commands:\nDeploy docker image in OpenShift cluster\nTo deploy the docker image with this option you need to configure your OpenShift. You could read how to configure it here.\nscript {\nprops = readJSON file: &apos;package.json&apos;\nwithCredentials([usernamePassword(credentialsId: &quot;${openShiftCredentials}&quot;, passwordVariable: &apos;pass&apos;, usernameVariable: &apos;user&apos;)]) {\nsh &quot;oc login -u ${user} -p ${pass} ${openshiftUrl} --insecure-skip-tls-verify&quot;\ntry {\nsh &quot;oc import-image ${props.name} --namespace=${openShiftNamespace} --from=${dockerRegistry}/${props.name}:${dockerTag} --confirm&quot;\n} catch (e) {\nsh &quot;&quot;&quot;\noc logs \\$(oc get builds -l build=${props.name} --namespace=${openShiftNamespace} --sort-by=.metadata.creationTimestamp -o name | tail -n 1) --namespace=${openShiftNamespace}\nthrow e\n&quot;&quot;&quot;\n}\n}\n}\nNote\nif your project is a maven project you should read the pom.xml file instead of the package.json, you could do it with the next command def pom = readMavenPom file: &apos;pom.xml&apos;. Due to the fact that there are different variable names between those two files, remember to modify ${props.name} for ${pom.artifactId} in the code.\nDeploy docker image using docker server\nTo deploy the docker image with this option you need to install docker and configure your docker server and also integrate it with Jenkins.\nscript {\ndocker.withRegistry(&quot;&quot;&quot;${dockerRegistryProtocol}${dockerRegistry}&quot;&quot;&quot;, dockerRegistryCredentials) {\ndef props = readJSON file: &apos;package.json&apos;\ndocker.image(&quot;${props.name}:${props.version}&quot;).pull()\ndef containerId = sh returnStdout: true, script: &quot;&quot;&quot;docker ps -aqf &quot;name=${containerName}${dockerEnvironment}&quot; &quot;&quot;&quot;\nif (containerId?.trim()) {\nsh &quot;docker rm -f ${containerId.trim()}&quot;\n}\nprintln &quot;&quot;&quot;docker run -d --name ${containerName}${dockerEnvironment} --network=${networkName} ${dockerRegistry}/${props.name}:${props.version}&quot;&quot;&quot;\nsh &quot;&quot;&quot;docker run -d --name ${containerName}${dockerEnvironment} --network=${networkName} ${dockerRegistry}/${props.name}:${props.version}&quot;&quot;&quot;\n}\n}\nNote\nif your project is a maven project you should read the pom.xml file instead of the package.json, you could do it with the next command def pom = readMavenPom file: &apos;pom.xml&apos;. Due to the fact that there are different variable names between those two files, remember to modify ${props.name} for ${pom.artifactId} and ${props.version} for ${pom.version} in the code.\nCheck status\nNow is time to check if your pods are running ok.\nTo check if your pods are ok in OpenShift you should add the next code to your pipeline:\nscript {\nprops = readJSON file: &apos;package.json&apos;\nsleep 30\nwithCredentials([usernamePassword(credentialsId: &quot;${openShiftCredentials}&quot;, passwordVariable: &apos;pass&apos;, usernameVariable: &apos;user&apos;)]) {\nsh &quot;oc login -u ${user} -p ${pass} ${openshiftUrl} --insecure-skip-tls-verify&quot;\nsh &quot;oc project ${openShiftNamespace}&quot;\ndef oldRetry = -1;\ndef oldState = &quot;&quot;;\nsh &quot;oc get pods -l app=${props.name} &gt; out&quot;\ndef status = sh (\nscript: &quot;sed &apos;s/[\\t ][\\t ]*/ /g&apos; &lt; out | sed &apos;2q;d&apos; | cut -d&apos; &apos; -f3&quot;,\nreturnStdout: true\n).trim()\ndef retry = sh (\nscript: &quot;sed &apos;s/[\\t ][\\t ]*/ /g&apos; &lt; out | sed &apos;2q;d&apos; | cut -d&apos; &apos; -f4&quot;,\nreturnStdout: true\n).trim().toInteger();\nwhile (retry &lt; 5 &amp;&amp; (oldRetry != retry || oldState != status)) {\nsleep 30\noldRetry = retry\noldState = status\nsh &quot;&quot;&quot;oc get pods -l app=${props.name} &gt; out&quot;&quot;&quot;\nstatus = sh (\nscript: &quot;sed &apos;s/[\\t ][\\t ]*/ /g&apos; &lt; out | sed &apos;2q;d&apos; | cut -d&apos; &apos; -f3&quot;,\nreturnStdout: true\n).trim()\nretry = sh (\nscript: &quot;sed &apos;s/[\\t ][\\t ]*/ /g&apos; &lt; out | sed &apos;2q;d&apos; | cut -d&apos; &apos; -f4&quot;,\nreturnStdout: true\n).trim().toInteger();\n}\nif(status != &quot;Running&quot;){\ntry {\nsh &quot;&quot;&quot;oc logs \\$(oc get pods -l app=${props.name} --sort-by=.metadata.creationTimestamp -o name | tail -n 1)&quot;&quot;&quot;\n} catch (e) {\nsh &quot;echo error reading logs&quot;\n}\nerror(&quot;The pod is not running, cause: &quot; + status)\n}\n}\n}\nPost operations\nWhen all its finish, remember to clean your workspace.\npost {\ncleanup {\ncleanWs()\n}\n}\nNote\nYou could also delete your dir adding the next command deleteDir().\nDockerfile\nYou have examples of dockerfiles in cicdgen repository.\ninside these folders you could find all the files that you need to use those dockerfiles. Two dockerfiles are provaided, Dockerfile and Dockerfile.ci, the first one is to compile the code and create the docker image used normally in local, and Dockerfile.ci is to use in Jenkins or similar, after building the application.\nvisit our devon4ng Dockerfiles.\nvisit our devon4j Dockerfiles.\nvisit our devon4node Dockerfiles.\nNote\nDockerfile.ci should be copied to de artifacts and renamed as Dockerfile to work.

OpenShift deployment environment manual configuration\nIn this section you will see how you can create a new environment instance in your OpenShift cluster to deploy devonfw projects using docker images.\nPrerequisites\ndevonfw project\nYo need to have a devonfw project in a git repository or a docker image uploaded to a docker registry.\nComunication between components\nOpenshift must have access to docker registry.\nDownload OpenShift Client Tools\nFirst of all you need to download the OpenShift client, you can find it here.\nRemember that what you need to download oc Client Tools and not OKD Server.\nNote\nThis tutorial has been made with the version 3.10.0 of the client, it is recommended to use the most current client, but if it does not work, it is possible that the instructions have become obsolete or that the OpenShift used needs another older/newer version of the client. To download a specific version of the client you can find here the older versions and the version 3.10.0.\nAdd oc client to path\nOnce you have downloaded the client you have to add it to the PATH environment variable.\nLog into OpenShift with admin account\nYou can log using a terminal and executing the next instructions:\noc login $OpenShiftUrl\nNote\nYou need a valid user to log in.\nSelect the project where you are going to create the environment\noc project $projectName\nAdd all the secrets that you need\nFor example, to create a secret for a nexus repository you should execute the next commands:\noc create secret docker-registry $nameForSecret --docker-server=${dockerRegistry} --docker-username=${user} --docker-password=${pass} --docker-email=no-reply@email.com\nConfigure OpenShift\nConfigure builds to create docker image using OpenShift\nIf you need to create docker images of your projects you could use OpenShift to do it (Off course only if you have enough rights).\nTo do it, follow the next steps.\nCreate new builds configs\nThe first thing you need to do for create a new environment is prepare the buildconfigs for the front and for the middleware and rise default memory limits for the middleware. You can do it using a terminal and executing the next instructions:\nThese are a summary about the parameters used in our commands:\n${dockerRegistry}: The url of the docker repository.\n${props.name}: The name of the project (for example could be find on package.json)\n${dockerTag}: The tag of the image\nNote\nFrom now on you will refer to the name that you are going to give to the environment as $enviroment. Remember to modify it for the correct value in all instructions.\ndevon4ng build config\nYou need to create nginx build config with docker.\noc new-build --strategy docker --binary --docker-image nginx:alpine-perl --name=${props.name}-$environment --to=${dockerRegistry}/${props.name}:${dockerTag} --to-docker=true\nNote\nYou need nginx:alpine-perl to read the environment config file in openshift, if you are not going to use it, you could use nginx:latest instead.\ndevon4node build config\noc new-build --strategy docker --binary --docker-image node:lts --name=${props.name}-$environment --to=${dockerRegistry}/${props.name}:${dockerTag} --to-docker=true\ndevon4j build config\noc new-build --strategy docker --binary --docker-image openjdk:&lt;version&gt; --name=${props.name}-$environment --to=${dockerRegistry}/${props.name}:${dockerTag} --to-docker=true\nNote\nYou need to specify the &lt;version&gt; of java used for your project. Also you can use the -alpine image. This image is based on the popular Alpine Linux project. Alpine Linux is much smaller than most distribution base images (~5MB), and thus leads to much slimmer images in general. More information on docker hub.\nHow to use the build\nIn this step is where you will build a docker image from a compiled application.\nPrerequisite\nTo build the source in OpenShift, first of all you need to compile your source and obtain the artifacts &quot;dist folder&quot; or download it from a repository. Normally the artifacts have been built on Jenkins and have been stored in Nexus.\nTo download it, you can access to your registry, select the last version and download the &quot;.tar&quot;. The next image shows an example of where is the link to download it, marked in yellow:\nBuild in OpenShift\nWhen you have the artifacts, you can send them to your openshift and build them using your buildconfig that you created on the previous step. This is going to create a new docker image and push it to your registry.\nIf your docker registry need credentials you should use a secret. You could add it to your buildconfig using the next command:\noc set build-secret --push bc/${props.name}-$environment ${nameForSecret}\nNow you can use your build config and push the docker image to your registry. To do it you need to use a terminal and execute the following:\noc start-build ${props.name}-$environment --from-dir=${artifactsPath} --follow\nNote\n${artifactsPath} is the path where you have the artifacts of the prerequisite (On jenkins is the dist folder generated by the build).\nNote\nMaybe you need to raise your memory or CPU limits.\nConfigure new environment\nNow it is time to configure the environment.\nPrerequisite\nYou need a docker image of your application. You could create it using OpenShift as you see in the last step.\nCreate new app on OpenShift\nTo create new app you need to use the next command.\noc new-app --docker-image=${artifactsPath} --name=${props.name}-$environment --source-secret=${nameForSecret}\nNote\nYou could add environment variables using -e $name=$value\nNote\nIf you do not need to use a secret remove the end part of the command --source-secret=${nameForSecret}\nCreate routes\nFinally, you need add a route to access the service.\nAdd http route\nIf you want to create an http route execute the following command in a terminal:\noc expose svc/${props.name}-$environment\nAdd https route\nIf you want to create an https route you can do it executing the following command:\noc create route edge --service=${props.name}-$environment\nIf you want to change the default route path you can use the command --hostname=$url. For example:\noc expose svc/${props.name}-$environment --hostname=$url\noc create route edge --service=${props.name}-$environment --hostname=$url\nImport new images from registry\nWhen you have new images in the registry you must import them to OpenShift. You could do it executing the next commands:\noc import-image ${props.name}-$environment --from=${dockerRegistry}/${props.name}:${dockerTag} --confirm\nNote\nMaybe you need to raise your memory or CPU limits. It is explained below.\nRaise/decrease memory or CPU limits\nIf you need to raise (or decrease) the memory or CPU limits that you need you could do it for your deployments and builders configurations following the next steps.\nFor deployments\nYou could do it in OpenShift using the user interface. To do it you should enter in OpenShift and go to deployments.\nAt the right top, you could see a drop down actions, click on it and you could edit the resource limits of the container.\nMaybe you should modify the resource limits of the pod too. To do it you should click on drop down actions and go to edit YAML. Then you could see something like the next image.\nIn the image, you could see that appear resources two times. One at the bottom of the image, this are the container resources that you modified on the previous paragraph and another one at the top of the image. The resources of the top are for the pod, you should give to it at least the same of the sum for all containers that the pod use.\nAlso you could do it using command line interface and executing the next command:\nTo modify pod limits\noc patch dc/boat-frontend-test --patch &apos;{&quot;spec&quot;:{&quot;strategy&quot;:{&quot;resources&quot;:{&quot;limits&quot;:{&quot;cpu&quot;: &quot;100m&quot;, &quot;memory&quot;: &quot;100Mi&quot;}, &quot;requests&quot;:{&quot;cpu&quot;: &quot;100m&quot;, &quot;memory&quot;: &quot;100Mi&quot;}}}}}&apos;\nTo modify container limits\nWhen this guide was written Openshift have a bug and you cannot do it from command line interface.\nNote\nIf that command did not work and you received an error like this error: unable to parse &quot;&apos;{spec:&#x2026;&#x200B;&quot;: yaml: found unexpected end of stream, try to use the patch using &quot;&quot; instead of &apos;&apos;. It looks like this: --patch &quot;{\\&quot;spec\\&quot;:&#x2026;&#x200B;\\&quot;}}}}&quot;\nFor builders\nYou could do it using command line interface and executing the next command:\noc patch bc/${props.name}${APP_NAME_SUFFIX} --patch &apos;{&quot;spec&quot;:{&quot;resources&quot;:{&quot;limits&quot;:{&quot;cpu&quot;: &quot;125m&quot;, &quot;memory&quot;: &quot;400Mi&quot;},&quot;requests&quot;:{&quot;cpu&quot;: &quot;125m&quot;, &quot;memory&quot;: &quot;400Mi&quot;}}}}&apos;\nNote\nIf that command did not work and you received an error like this error: unable to parse &quot;&apos;{spec:&#x2026;&#x200B;&quot;: yaml: found unexpected end of stream, try to use the patch using &quot;&quot; instead of &apos;&apos;.

The better that you can do is stop it manually when Declarative: Checkout SCM is over.\nThen you could see a button to Build with Parameters, click on it and fill the next form, these are the parameters:\nDocker registry credentials for OpenShift\nCREATE_SECRET: This option allows you to add the credentials of your docker registry in your OpenShift and stored it as a secret called docker-registry + registry_secret_name_suffix value.\nRemember that you only need one secret to connect with your registry per namespace, if you are going to add more than one application in the same namespace that use the same registry, use the same name suffix and please do not create more than one secret in the same namespace. The namespace is the OpenShift project when you are going to deploy your application.\nYou can see your secrets stored in OpenShift going to OpenShift and click on the left menu:\nNote\nIf the secret exists, you should uncheck the checkbox and fill the name suffix to use it.\nREGISTRY_SECRET_NAME_SUFFIX: This is the suffix of the name for your docker registry credentials stored in OpenShift as a secret. The name is going to be docker-registry + this suffix, if you use more than one docker-registry in the same namespace you need to add a suffix. For example you could add the name of your project, then to have the name as docker-registry-myprojectname you should use -myprojectname value.\nBuild your docker image using OpenShift and store it in your docker registry\nCREATE_DOCKER_BUILDER: This option allows you to create a build configuration in your OpenShift to create the docker images of your project and store them in your docker registry. If you are going to create the builder, your application is needed, you need to specify where is your git repository and which is the branch and credentials to use it.\nThe following parameters of this section are only necessary if a builder is to be created.\nGIT_REPOSITORY: This is the url of your git repository.\nNote\nIf you are using production line, remember to use the internal rout of your repository, to use it you must change the base url of your production line for the internal route http://gitlab-core:80/gitlab. For example, if your production line repository is for example https://shared-services.pl.s2-eu.capgemini.com/gitlab/boat/boat-frontend.git use http://gitlab-core:80/gitlab/boat/boat-frontend.git)\nGIT_BRANCH: This is the branch that we are going to use for creating the first docker image. The next time that you are going to use the builder you could use another branches.\nGIT_CREDENTIALS: This is the credentials id stored in your jenkins to download the code from your git repository.\nBUILD_SCRIPT: In case of use devon4ng or devon4node you could specify which is the build script used to build and create the first docker image with this builder.\nJAVA_VERSION In case of use devon4j this is the java version used for your docker image.\nDocker registry information\nDOCKER_REGISTRY: This is the url of your docker registry.\nNote\nIf you are using production line, the url of your registry is docker-registry- + your production line url. For example, if your production line is shared-services.pl.s2-eu.capgemini.com your docker registry is docker-registry-shared-services.pl.s2-eu.capgemini.com.\nIf you cannot access to your docker registry, please open an incident in i4u.\nDOCKER_REGISTRY_CREDENTIALS: This is the credentials id stored in your jenkins to download or upload docker images in your docker registry.\nDOCKER_TAG: This is the tag that is going to be used for the builder to push the docker image and for the deployment config to pull and deploy it.\nOpenShift cluster information\nOPENSHIFT_URL: This is the url of your OpenShift cluster.\nOPENSHIFT_CREDENTIALS: This is the credentials id stored in your jenkins to use OpenShift.\nOPENSHIFT_NAMESPACE: This is the name of the project in your OpenShift where you are going to use. The name of the project in OpenShift is called namespace.\nTake care because although you see at the top of your OpenShift interface the name of the project that you are using, this name is the display-name and not the value that you need. To obtain the correct value you must check your OpenShift url like you see in the next image:\nAPP_NAME_SUFFIX: The name of all things created in your OpenShift project are going to be called as the configuration of your application says. Normaly, our projects use a suffix that depends on the environment. You can see the values in the next list:\nFor develop branch we use -dev\nFor release branch we use -uat\nFor master branch we use -prod\nHOSTNAME: If you do not specify nothing, OpenShift is going to autogenerate a valid url for your application. You could modify the value by default but be sure that you configure everything to server your application in the route that you specify.\nSECURED_PROTOCOL: If true, the protocol for the route will be https otherwise will be http.\nJenkins tools\nAll those parameters are the name of the tools in your Jenkinsfile.\nTo obtain it you need enter in your Jenkins and go to Manage Jenkins clicking on left menu and enter in Global Tool Configuration or in Managed files.\nOPENSHIFT_TOOL: Is located in Global tool configuration.\nNODEJS_TOOL: Is located in Global tool configuration.\nYARN_TOOL: Is located in Global tool configuration, inside the custom tools.\nGLOBAL_SETTINGS_ID Is located in Managed files. You need to click on edit button and take the id.\nMAVEN_INSTALLATION Is located in Global tool configuration.\n&#x2190;&#xA0;Previous:&#xA0;Create project&#xA0;| &#x2191;&#xA0;Up:&#xA0;devonfw shop floor&#xA0;| &#x2302;&#xA0;Home:&#xA0;devonfw guide&#xA0;| Next:&#xA0;Monitoring&#xA0;&#x2192;\n"},{"id":893,"path":"../..\\..\\..\\..\\..\\xampp\\htdocs\\devonfw.github.io\\website\\pages\\docs/master-devonfw-shop-floor.asciidoc_monitoring.html#master-devonfw-shop-floor.asciidoc_monitoring","type":"docs","title":"Monitoring","body":"59.

Junit4 to Junit5 migration guide\nmrchecker-core-module version 5.6.2.1 features the upgrade of Junit4 to Junit5. Consequently, the Junit4 features are now obsolete and current test projects require migration\nin order to use the latest revision of MrChecker. This site provides guidance on the migration.\nReferences:\nJunit5 User Guide - https://junit.org/junit5/docs/current/user-guide/#overview\nPOM\nThe project pom.xml file needs to be adjusted in the first place. An exemplary POM file for download can be found here: https://github.com/devonfw/mrchecker/blob/develop/template/pom.xml\nTest Annotations\nJunit5 redefines annotations defining a test flow. The annotations need to be adjusted as per the following table.\nRule, ClassRule, TestRule and TestMethod\nJunit4 @Rule and @ClassRule annoations as well as TestRule and TestMethod interfaces have been replaced\nwith the Junit5 extension mechanism (https://junit.org/junit5/docs/current/user-guide/#extensions).\nDuring the migration to Junit5, all the instances of the mentioned types need to be rewritten according to the Junit5 User Guide.\nThe extension mechanism is far more flexible than the Junit4 functionality based on rules.\nNote: as per Junit5 API spec: ExpectedExceptionSupport,&#xA0;ExternalResourceSupport,&#xA0;VerifierSupport\nprovide native support of the correspoinding Junit4 rules.\nExtension registration example:\nTestRule (TestWatcher and ExternalResource) to Extension (TestWatcher and AfterAllCallback) example:\nPage, BasePageAutoRegistration and PageFactory classes\nPage class is a new MrChecker class. It was introduced to provide common implemenation for its subpages in specific MrChecker modules.\nIn order to receive test lifecycle notifications, particular Pages need to be registered by calling addToTestExecutionObserver() method.\nTo facilitate this process, PageFactory class was designed and it&#x2019;s usage is a recommended way of creating Page objects for tests.\nAlthough in MrChecker based on Junit4, the registration process was done in a specific BasePage constructor, it&#x2019;s been considered error prone and reimplemented.\nFurthermore, to reduce migration cost BasePageAutoRegistration classes are available in MrChceker modules. They use the old way of registration.\nGiven that three ways of migration are possible.\nMigration with PageFactory class example (RECOMMENDED):\nMigration with calling addToTestExecutionObserver() method example:\nMigration with BasePageAutoRegistration class example:\nTest suites\nTest suite migration example:\nRunning tests from Maven:\nConcurrency\nJunit5 provides native thread count and parallel execution control in contrast to Junit4 where it was controlled by Maven Surefire plugin.\nTo enable concurrent test execution, junit-platform.properties file needs to placed in the test/resources directory of a project.\nExemplary file contents:\nA ready-to-use file can be found here.\nMrChecker supports only concurrent test class execution.\n@ResourceLock can be used to synchronize between classes if needed:\nCucumber\nIf Cucumber is used in a project, it is neccessary to change a hook class.\nAn exemplary hook source file for download can be found here.\nData driven tests\nJunit5 implements new approach to data driven tests by various data resolution mechanisms.\nAn example of method source parameters migration version one:\nAn example of method source parameters migration version two:\nAn example of method source in another class parameters migration:\nProviding parameters directly in annotations has no analogy in Junit5 and needs to be replaced with e.g. method source:\nAn example of csv parameters source with no header line migration:\nAn example of csv parameters source with the header line migration:\nAn example of csv parameters source with object mapping migration step1:\nAn example of csv parameters source with object mapping migration step 2:\nsetUp() and tearDown()\nBaseTest.setUp() and BaseTest.tearDown() methods are now not abstract and need no implementation in subclasses. @Override when a custom implemenatation is needed.\n&#x2190;&#xA0;Previous:&#xA0;Tutorials&#xA0;| &#x2191;&#xA0;Up:&#xA0;MrChecker - devonfw testing tool&#xA0;| &#x2302;&#xA0;Home:&#xA0;devonfw guide&#xA0;| Next:&#xA0;FAQ&#xA0;&#x2192;\n"},{"id":921,"path":"../..\\..\\..\\..\\..\\xampp\\htdocs\\devonfw.github.io\\website\\pages\\docs/master-mrchecker.asciidoc_mrchecker-download.html#master-mrchecker.asciidoc_mrchecker-download","type":"docs","title":"MrChecker download","body":"79.

Very often misunderstandings between business and IT result in the costly failure of IT projects. With this in mind, Cucumber was developed as a tool to support human collaboration between business and IT.\nCucumber uses executable specifications to encourage a close collaboration. This helps teams to keep the business goal in mind at all times. With Cucumber you can merge specification and test documentation into one cohesive whole, allowing your team to maintain one single source of truth. Because these executable specifications are automatically tested by Cucumber, your single source of truth is always up-to-date.\nCucumber supports testers when designing test cases. To automate these test cases, several languages can be used. Cucumber also works well with Browser Automation tools such as Selenium Webdriver.\nSelenium\nSelenium automates browsers and is used for automating web applications for testing purposes. Selenium offers testers and developers full access to the properties of objects and the underlying tests, via a scripting environment and integrated debugging options.\nSelenium consists of many parts. If you want to create robust, browser-based regression automation suites and tests, Selenium Webdriver is most appropriate. With Selenium Webdriver you can also scale and distribute scripts across many environments.\nStrengths\nSupports BDD\nThose familiar with Behavior Driven Development (BDD) recognize Cucumber as an excellent open source tool that supports this practice.\nAll in one place\nWith Cucumber / Selenium you can automate at the UI level. Automation at the unit or API level can also be implemented using Cucumber. This means all tests, regardless of the level at which they are implemented, can be implemented in one tool.\nMaintainable test scripts\nMany teams seem to prefer UI level automation, despite huge cost of maintaining UI level tests compared to the cost of maintaining API or unit tests. To lessen the maintenance of UI testing, when designing UI level functional tests, you can try describing the test and the automation at three levels: business rule, UI workflow, technical implementation.\nWhen using Cucumber combined with Selenium, you can implement these three levels for better maintenance.\nEarly start\nExecutable specifications can and should be written before the functionality is implemented. By starting early, teams get most return on investment from their test automation.\nSupported by a large community\nCucumber and Selenium are both open source tools with a large community, online resources and mailing lists.\nHow to run cucumber tests in Mr.Checker\nCommand line / Jenkins\nRun cucumber tests and generate Allure report. Please use this for Jenkins execution. Report is saved under ./target/site.\nmvn clean -P cucumber test site\nRun and generate report\nmvn clean -P cucumber test site allure:report\nRun cucumber tests, generate Allure report and start standalone report server\nmvn clean -P cucumber test site allure:serve\nEclipse IDE\nTooling\nCucumber\nCucumber supports over a dozen different software platforms. Every Cucumber implementation provides the same overall functionality, but they also have their own installation procedure and platform-specific functionality. See https://cucumber.io/docs for all Cucumber implementations and framework implementations.\nAlso, IDEs such as Intellij offer several plugins for Cucumber support.\nSelenium\nSelenium has the support of some of the largest browser vendors who have taken (or are taking) steps to make Selenium a native part of their browser. It is also the core technology in countless other browser automation tools, APIs and frameworks.\nAutomation process\nWrite a feature file\nTest automation in Cucumber starts with writing a feature file. A feature normally consists of several (test)scenarios and each scenario consists of several steps.\nFeature: Refund item\nScenario: Jeff returns a faulty microwave\nGiven Jeff has bought a microwave for $100\nAnd he has a receipt\nWhen he returns the microwave\nThen Jeff should be refunded $100\nAbove example shows a feature &#x201C;Refund item&#x201D; with one scenario &#x201C;Jeff returns a faulty microwave&#x201D;. The scenario consists of four steps each starting with a key word (Given, And, When, Then).\nImplementing the steps\nNext the steps are implemented. Assuming we use Java to implement the steps, the Java code will look something like this.\npublic class MyStepdefs \\{\n@Given(&quot;Jeff has bought a microwave for $(\\d+)&quot;)\npublic void Jeff_has_bought_a_microwave_for(int amount) \\{\n// implementation can be plain java\n// or selenium\ndriver.findElement(By.name(&quot;test&quot;)).sendKeys(&quot;This is an example\\n&quot;);\ndriver.findElement(By.name(&quot;button&quot;)).click();// etc\n}\n}\nCucumber uses an annotation (highlighted) to match the step from the feature file with the function implementing the step in the Java class. The name of the class and the function can be as the developer sees fit. Selenium code can be used within the function to automate interaction with the browser.\nRunning scenarios\nThere are several ways to run scenarios with Cucumber, for example the JUnit runner, a command line runner and several third party runners.\nReporting test results\nCucumber can report results in several different formats, using formatter plugins\nFeatures\nFeature files using Gherkin\nCucumber executes your feature files. As shown in the example below, feature files in Gherkin are easy to read so they can be shared between IT and business. Data tables can be used to execute a scenario with different inputs.\nOrganizing tests\nFeature files are placed in a directory structure and together form a feature tree.\nTags can be used to group features based on all kinds of categories. Cucumber can include or exclude tests with certain tags when running the tests.\nReporting test results\nCucumber can report results in several formats, using formatter plugins.\nNot supported option by Shared Services: The output from Cucumber can be used to present test results in Jenkins or Hudson depending of the preference of the project.\nHOW IS Cucumber / Selenium USED AT Capgemini?\nTool deployment\nCucumber and Selenium are chosen as one of Capgemini&#x2019;s test automation industrial tools. We support the Java implementation of Cucumber and Selenium Webdriver. We can help with creating Cucumber, Selenium projects in Eclipse and IntelliJ.\nApplication in ATaaS (Automated Testing as a Service)\nIn the context of industrialisation, Capgemini has developed a range of services to assist and support the projects in process and tools implementation.\nIn this context a team of experts assists projects using test automation.\nThe main services provided by the center of expertise are:\nAdvise on the feasibility of automation.\nSupport with installation.\nCoaching teams in the use of BDD.\n"},{"id":941,"path":"../..\\..\\..\\..\\..\\xampp\\htdocs\\devonfw.github.io\\website\\pages\\docs/master-mrchecker.asciidoc_test-framework-modules.html#Core-Test-Module-Run-on-independent-Operating-Systems.asciidoc","type":"docs","title":"Run on independent Operation Systems","body":"78.1.12.

What is Selenium\nSelenium is a framework for testing browser applications. The test automation supports:\nFrequent regression testing\nRepeating test case executions\nDocumentation of test cases\nFinding defects\nMultiple Browsers\nThe Selenium testing framework consists of multiple tools:\nSelenium IDE\nThe Selenium Integrated Development Environment is a prototyping tool for building test scripts. It is a Firefox Plugin and provides an easy-to-use interface for developing test cases. Additionally, Selenium IDE contains a recording feature, that allows the user to record user inputs that can be automatically re-executed in future.\nSelenium 1\nSelenium 1, also known as Selenium RC, commands a Selenium Server to launch and kill browsers, interpreting the Selenese commands passed from the test program. The Server acts as an HTTP proxy. This tool is deprecated.\nSelenium 2\nSelenium 2, also known as Selenium WebDriver, is designed to supply a well-designed, object-oriented API that provides improved support for modern advanced web-app testing problems.\nSelenium 3.0\nThe major change in Selenium 3.0 is removing the original Selenium Core implementation and replacing it with one backed by WebDriver. There is now a W3C specification for browser automation, based on the Open Source WebDriver.\nSelenium Grid\nSelenium Grid allows the scaling of Selenium RC test cases, that must be run in multiple and potentially variable environments. The tests can be run in parallel on different remote machines.\nSelenium on the Production Line\nMore information on Selenium on the Production Line can be found here.\ntl;dr\nThe Production Line has containers running Chrome and Firefox Selenium Nodes. The communication with these nodes is accomplished using Selenium Grid.\nHaving issues using Selenium on the Production Line?

What is WebDriver\nOn the one hand, it is a very convenient API for a programmer that allows for interaction with the browser, on the other hand it is a driver concept that enables this direct communication.\nHow does it work?\nA tester, through their test script, can command WebDriver to perform certain actions on the WAUT on a certain browser. The way the user can command WebDriver to perform something is by using the client libraries or language bindings provided by WebDriver.\nBy using the language-binding client libraries, a tester can invoke browser-specific implementations of WebDriver, such as Firefox Driver, IE Driver, Opera Driver, and so on, to interact with the WAUT of the respective browser. These browser-specific implementations of WebDriver will work with the browser natively and execute commands from outside the browser to simulate exactly what the application user does.\nAfter execution, WebDriver will send the test result back to the test script for developer&#x2019;s analysis.\n"},{"id":955,"path":"../..\\..\\..\\..\\..\\xampp\\htdocs\\devonfw.github.io\\website\\pages\\docs/master-mrchecker.asciidoc_test-framework-modules.html#Selenium-Test-Module-What-is-Page-Object-Model-Pattern.asciidoc","type":"docs","title":"What is Page Object Model?","body":"78.3.3. What is Page Object Model?\nCreating Selenium test cases can result in an unmaintainable project. One of the reasons is that too much duplicated code is used. Duplicated code could result from duplicated functionality leading to duplicated usage of locators. The main disadvantage of duplicated code is that the project is less maintainable. If a locator changes, you have to walk through the whole test code to adjust locators where necessary. By using the page object model we can make non-brittle test code and reduce or eliminate duplicate test code. In addition, it improves the readability and allows us to create interactive documentation. Last but not least, we can create tests with less keystroke. An implementation of the page object model can be achieved by separating the abstraction of the test object and the test scripts.\n"},{"id":956,"path":"../..\\..\\..\\..\\..\\xampp\\htdocs\\devonfw.github.io\\website\\pages\\docs/master-mrchecker.asciidoc_test-framework-modules.html#Selenium-Test-Module-List-of-web-elements.asciidoc","type":"docs","title":"Basic Web elements","body":"78.3.4.

Page Class\nPage Object Models allow for the representation of a webpage as a Java Class. The class contains all required web elements like buttons, textfields, labels, etc. When initializing a new project, create a new package to store the Page Object Models in.\nInitialization\nSource folder: allure-app-under-test/src/main/java\nName: com.example.selenium.pages.YOUR_PROJECT\nClasses being created inside of this new package have to extend the BasePage class. As a result, a few abstract methods from BasePage have to be implemented.\npublic class DemoPage extends BasePage {\n@Override\npublic boolean isLoaded() {\n}\n@Override\npublic void load() {\n}\n@Override\npublic String pageTitle() {\n}\n}\nThe example above demonstrates a minimum valid Page Object class with all required methods included.\nBasePage method: isLoaded\nThe inherited method isLoaded() can be used to check if the current Page Object Model has been loaded correctly. There are multiple ways to verify a correctly loaded page. One example would be to compare the actual page title with the expected page title.\npublic boolean isLoaded() {\nif(getDriver().getTitle().equals(&quot;EXPECTED_TITLE&quot;)) {\nreturn true;\n}\nreturn false;\n}\nBasePage method: load\nThe method load() can be used to tell the webdriver to load a specific page.\npublic void load() {\ngetDriver().get(&quot;http://SOME_PAGE&quot;);\n}\nBasePage method: pageTitle\nThe pageTitle() method returns a String containing the page title.\nCreating a selector variable\nTo initialize web elements, a large variety of selectors can be used.\nWe recommend creating a private and constant field for every web element you&#x2019;d like to represent in Java. Use the guide above to find the preferred selector and place it in the code below at &quot;WEB_ELEMENT_SELECTOR&quot;.\nprivate static final By someWebElementSelector = By.CSS(&quot;WEB_ELEMENT_SELECTOR&quot;);\nAs soon as you create the selector above, you can make use of it to initialize a WebElement object.\nWebElement someWebElement = getDriver().findDynamicElement(someWebElementSelector);\nNote: The examples displayed in the cssSelector.docx file use the Selenium method driver.findElement() to find elements. However, using this framework we recommend findDynamicElement() or findQuietlyElement().findDynamicElement() allows waiting for dynamic elements, for example buttons that pop up.\nCreating a page method\nTo interact with the page object, we recommend creating methods for each action.\npublic void enterGoogleSearchInput(String query) {\n...\n}\nCreating a method like the one above allows the test case to run something like googleSearchPage.enterGoogleSearchInput(&quot;Hello&quot;) to interact with the page object.\nNaming Conventions\nFor code uniformity and readability, we provide a few method naming conventions.\nElement\nAction\nName (example)\nForm: Input text\nenter\nenterUsernameInput()\nis (label)\nisUsernameInputPresent()\nis (value)\nisUsernameEmpty()\nget\ngetUsernameValue()\nForm: Label\nget\ngetCashValue()\nis (value)\nisCashValueEmpty()\nis (label)\nisCashLabelPresent()\nForm: Submit Button\nsubmit\nsubmitLoginForm()\nis\nisLoginFormPresent()\nPage: Button\nclick\nclickInfoButton()\nis\nisInfoButtonpresent()\nCheckbox\nset\nsetRememberMeCheckbox()\nunset\nunsetRememberMeCheckbox()\nis (present)\nisRememberMeCheckboxPresent()\nis (value)\nisRememberMeCheckboxSet()\nRadio\nset\nsetMaleRadioValue(&quot;Woman&quot;)\nis (present)\nisMaleRadioPresent()\nis (visible)\nisMaleRadioVisible()\nget\ngetSelectedMaleValue()\nElements (Tabs, Cards, Account, etc.)\nclick\nclickPositionTab() / clickMyBilanceCard()\nis\nisMyBilanceCardPresent()\nDropdown List\nselect\nselectAccountTypeValue(typeName)\nunselect\nunselectAccountTypeValue(typeName)\nmultiple select\nselectAccountTypesValues(List typeNames)\nis (list)\nisAccountTypeDropdownListPresent()\nis (element present)\nisAccountTypeElementPresent(typeName)\nis (element selected)\nisAccountTypeSelected(typeName)\nLink\nclick\nclickMoreLink()\nis\nisMoreLinkPresent()\nCombobox\nselect\nselectSortCombobox()\nis (present)\nisSortComboboxPresent(name)\nis (contain)\nselectSortComboboxContain(name)\nElement Attribute\nget\ngetPositionTabCss()\nget\ngetMoreLinkHref() / getRememberMeCheckboxName()\nA css selector is used to select elements from an HTML page.\nSelection by element tag, class or id are the most common selectors.\n&lt;p class=&apos;myText&apos; id=&apos;123&apos;&gt;\nThis text element (p) can be found by using any one of the following selectors:\nThe HTML element: &quot;p&quot;. Note: in practical use this will be too generic, if a preceding text section is added, the selected element will change.\nThe class attribute preceded by &quot;.&quot;: &quot;.myText&quot;\nThe id attribute preceded by &quot;#&quot;: &quot;#123&quot;\nUsing other attributes\nWhen a class or an id attribute is not sufficient to identify an element, other attributes can be used as well, by using &quot;[attribute=value]&quot;: For example:\n&lt;a href=&apos;https://ns.nl/example.html&apos;&gt;\nThis can be selected by using the entire value: &quot;a[href=&apos;https://ns.nl/example.html&apos;\\]&quot;. For selecting links starting with, containing, ending with see the list below.\nUsing sub-elements\nThe css selectors can be stacked, by appending them:\n&lt;div id=&apos;1&apos;&gt;&lt;a href=&apos;ns.nl&apos;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div id=&apos;2&apos;&gt;&lt;a href=&apos;nsinternational.nl&apos;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\nIn the example above, the link element to nsinternational can be obtained with: &quot;#2 a&quot;.\nWhen possible avoid\nUsing paths of commonly used HTML elements within the containers (HTML: div). This will cause failures when a container is added, a common occurrence during development, e.g. &quot;div div p&quot;. Use class or id instead, if those are not available, request them to be added in the production code.\nMagic order numbers. It is possible to get the second text element in its parent container by using the selector &quot;p:nth-child(2)&quot;. If the items are representing different items, ask the developer to add specific attributes. It is also possible to request all items, with a selector similar to &quot;.myList li&quot;, and iterate through them later.\nList\nA good list with CSS Selectors can be found at W3Schools:\nhttps://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_selectors.asp\n"},{"id":959,"path":"../..\\..\\..\\..\\..\\xampp\\htdocs\\devonfw.github.io\\website\\pages\\docs/master-mrchecker.asciidoc_test-framework-modules.html#Selenium-Test-Module-Selenium-UFT-Comparison.asciidoc","type":"docs","title":"Selenium UFT Comparison","body":"78.4.2.

Is it doable to keep pace in QA with today&#x2019;s software agile approach?\nDevOps + Microservices + Shift left + Time to Market == ? Service virtualization ?\nTest pyramid\nWhat is service virtualization\nService Virtualization has become recognized as one of the best ways to speed up testing and accelerate your time to market.\nService virtualization lets you automatically execute tests even when the application under test&#x2019;s dependent system components (APIs, third-party applications, etc.) cannot be properly accessed or configured for testing. By simulating these dependencies, you can ensure that your tests will encounter the appropriate dependency behaviour and data each and every time that they execute.\nService virtualization is the simulation of interfaces &#x2013; not the virtualization of systems.\nAccording to Wikipedia&#x2019;s service virtualization entry: Service virtualization emulates the behaviour of software components to remove dependency constraints on development and testing teams. Such constraints occur in complex, interdependent environments when a component connected to the application under test is:\nNot yet completed\nStill evolving\nControlled by a third-party or partner\nAvailable for testing only in a limited capacity or at inconvenient times\nDifficult to provision or configure in a test environment\nNeeded for simultaneous access by different teams with varied test data setup and other requirements\nRestricted or costly to use for load and performance testing\nFor instance, instead of virtualizing an entire database (and performing all associated test data management as well as setting up the database for every test session), you monitor how the application interacts with the database, then you emulate the related database behaviour (the SQL queries that are passed to the database, the corresponding result sets that are returned, and so forth).\nMocks, stubs and virtual services\nThe most commonly discussed categories of test doubles are mocks, stubs and virtual services.\nStub: a minimal implementation of an interface that normally returns hardcoded data that is tightly coupled to the test suite. It is most useful when the suite of tests is simple and keeping the hardcoded data in the stub is not an issue. Some stubs are handwritten; some can be generated by tools. A stub is normally written by a developer for personal use. It can be shared with testers, but wider sharing is typically limited by interoperability issues related to software platform and deployment infrastructure dependencies that were hardcoded. A common practice is when a stub works in-process directly with classes, methods, and functions for the unit, module, and acceptance testing. Some developers will say that a stub can also be primed, but you cannot verify an invocation on a stub. Stubs can also be communicating &quot;over the wire&quot;, for example, HTTP, but some would argue that they should be called virtual services in that case.\nMock: a programmable interface observer, that verifies outputs against expectations defined by the test. It is frequently created using a third party library, for example in Java that is Mockito, JMock or WireMock. It is most useful when you have a large suite of tests and a stub will not be sufficient because each test needs a different data set up and maintaining them in a stub would be costly. The mock lets us keep the data set-up in the test. A mock is normally written by a developer for personal use but it can be shared with testers. However, wider sharing is typically limited by interoperability issues related to software platform and deployment infrastructure dependencies that were hardcoded. They are most often work-in-progress directly with classes, methods, and functions for a unit, module, and acceptance testing. Mock provides responses based on a given request satisfying predefined criteria (also called request or parameter matching). A mock also focuses on interactions rather than state so mocks are usually stateful. For example, you can verify how many times a given method was called or the order of calls made to a given object.\nVirtual service: a test double often provided as a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS), is always called remotely, and is never working in-process directly with methods or functions. A virtual service is often created by recording traffic using one of the service virtualization platforms instead of building the interaction pattern from scratch based on interface or API documentation. A virtual service can be used to establish a common ground for teams to communicate and facilitate artefact sharing with other development teams as well as testing teams. A virtual service is called remotely (over HTTP, TCP, etc.) normally supports multiple protocols (e.g. HTTP, MQ, TCP, etc.), while a stub or mock normally supports only one. Sometimes virtual services will require users to authorize, especially when deployed in environments with enterprise-wide visibility. Service virtualization tools used to create virtual services will most often have user interfaces that allow less tech-savvy software testers to hit the ground running, before diving into the details of how specific protocols work. They are sometimes backed by a database. They can also simulate non-functional characteristics of systems such as response times or slow connections. You can sometimes find virtual services that provide a set of stubbed responses for given request criteria and pass every other request to a live backend system (partial stubbing). Similar to mocks, virtual services can have quite complex request matchers, that allow having one response returned for many different types of requests. Sometimes, virtual services simulate system behaviours by constructing parts of the response based on request attributes and data.\nIt is often difficult to say definitely which of the following categories a test double fits into. They should be treated as a spectrum rather than strict definitions.\n"},{"id":966,"path":"../..\\..\\..\\..\\..\\xampp\\htdocs\\devonfw.github.io\\website\\pages\\docs/master-mrchecker.asciidoc_test-framework-modules.html#Web-API-Test-Module-How-plug-in-service-virtualization-into-Application-Under-Test.asciidoc","type":"docs","title":"Plug in service virtualization","body":"78.5.3.

Map requests with virtual assets\nWhat is WireMock?\nWireMock is an HTTP mock server. At its core it is a web server that can be primed to serve canned responses to particular requests (stubing) and that captures incoming requests so that they can be checked later (verification). It also has an assortment of other useful features including record/playback of interactions with other APIs, injection of faults and delays, simulation of stateful behaviour.\nFull documentation can be found under the following link: WireMock\nRecord / create virtual assets mappings\nRecord\nWireMock can create stub mappings from requests it has received. Combined with its proxying feature, this allows you to &quot;record&quot; stub mappings from interaction with existing APIs.\nRecord and playback (Legacy): documentation\njava -jar wiremock-standalone-2.16.0.jar --proxy-all=&quot;http://search.twitter.com&quot; --record-mappings --verbose\nOnce it&#x2019;s started and request is sent to it, it will be redirected to &quot;http://search.twitter.com&quot; and traffic (response) is saved to files in mappings and __files directories for further use.\nRecord and playback (New): documentation\nEnable mappings in a virtual server\nWhen the WireMock server starts, it creates two directories under the current one: mappings and __files. To create a stub, it is necessary to drop a file with a .json extension under mappings.\nRun docker with mounted volumes\nMappings are in a repository. It is necessary to mount directories with already created mappings and responses to make it work:\nsudo docker run -td -p 8080:8080 -v /home/wiremock/repo/app/docker/QA/mappings:/app/mappings -v /home/wiremock/repo/app/docker/QA/__files:/app/__files --restart always docker.xxx.com/app/build/wiremock:v2.14.0.\nThe description of how to build and run docker is available under: Docker run command description\nRecorded mappings\nRecorded mappings are kept in the project repository.\nCreate a user and map them to docker user\nTo enable the connection from Jenkins to Virtual Server (C2C), it is necessary to create a user and map them to docker group user. It can be done using the following command:\nadduser -G docker -m wiremock\nTo set the password for a wiremock user:\npasswd wiremock\nCreate SSH private and public keys for a wiremock user\nSSH keys serve as a means of identifying yourself to an SSH server using public-key cryptography and challenge-response authentication. One immediate advantage this method has over traditional password is that you can be authenticated by the server without ever having to send your password over the network.\nTo create an SSH key, log in as wiremock (previously created user).\nsu wiremock\nThe .ssh directory is not by default created below user home directory. Therefore, it is necessary to create it:\nmkdir ~/.ssh\nNow we can proceed with creating an RSA key using ssh-keygen (a tool for creating new authentication key pairs for SSH):\nssh-keygen -t rsa\nA key should be created under /.ssh/id_rsa\nAppending the public keys to authorized_keys:\nwiremock@vc2crptXXXXXXXn:~/ssh$ cat id_rsa.pub &gt;&gt; authorized_keys\nInstall an SSH key in Jenkins\nTo add an SSH key to Jenkins, go to credentials in your job location. Choose the folder within credentials, then &apos;global credentials&apos;, &apos;Add credentials&apos;. Fill in the fields. Finally, the entry should be created.\nBuild a Jenkins Groovy script\nThe description of how to use SSH Agent plugin in Jenkins pipeline can be found under: https://www.karthikeyan.tech/2017/09/ssh-agent-blue-ocean-via-jenkins.html\nExample of use:\nsshagent (credentials: [env.WIREMOCK_CREDENTIALS]) {\nsh &quot;&quot;&quot;\nssh -T -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no -l ${env.WIREMOCK_USERNAME} ${env.WIREMOCK_IP_ADDRESS} &quot;docker container restart ${env.WIREMOCK_CONTAINER_NAME}&quot;\n&quot;&quot;&quot;\n}\nWhere: env.WIREMOCK_CREDENTIALS is a credential id of previously created wiremock credentials. Now that it is present, we can execute commands on a remote machine, where in ssh command:\nenv.WIREMOCK_USERNAME - user name of user connected with configured private key\nenv.WIREMOCK_IP_ADDRESS - ip address of the machine where this user with this private key exists\nPull repository with virtual assets\nTo pull the repository on a remote machine, it is necessary to use the previously described SSH Agent plugin. An example of use:\nsshagent (credentials: [env.WIREMOCK_CREDENTIALS]) {\nwithCredentials([usernamePassword(credentialsId: end.STASH_CREDENTIALS, passwordVariable: &apos;PASS&apos;, usernameVariable: &apos;USER&apos;)]) {\nsh &quot;&quot;&quot;\nssh -T -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no -l ${env.WIREMOCK_USERNAME} ${env.WIREMOCK_IP_ADDRESS} &quot;cd ~/${env.APPLICATION_DIRECTORY_WIREMOCK}/${env.PROJET_HOME}; git fetch https://&amp;USER:$PASS@${env.GIT_WITHOUT_HTTPS} ${env.GIT_BRANCH}; git reset --hard FETCH_HEAD; git clean -df&quot;\n&quot;&quot;&quot;\n}\n}\nWhere:\nwithCredentials allows various kinds of credentials (secrets) to be used in idiosyncratic ways. Each binding will define an environment variable active within the scope of the step. Then the necessary commands are executed:\ncd &#x2026;&#x200B; - command will change from current directory to the specified directory with git repository\ngit fetch &#x2026;&#x200B; ;git reset &#x2026;&#x200B; ;git clean &#x2026;&#x200B; - pull from GIT branch.

Security Test Module\nWhat is Security\nApplication Security is concerned with Integrity, Availability and Confidentiality of data processed, stored and transferred by the application.\nApplication Security is a cross-cutting concern which touches every aspect of the Software Development Lifecycle. You can introduce some SQL injection flaws in your application and make it exploitable, but you can also expose your secrets (which will have nothing to do with code itself) due to poor secret management process, and fail as well.\nBecause of this and many other reasons, not every aspect of security can be automatically verified. Manual tests and audits will still be needed. Nevertheless, every security requirement which is automatically verified will prevent code degeneration and misconfiguration in a continuous manner.\nHow to test Security\nSecurity tests can be performed in many different ways, such as:\nStatic Code Analysis - improves the security by (usually) automated code review. A good way to search for vulnerabilities, which are &apos;obvious&apos; on the code level ( e.g. SQL injection). The downside of this approach is that professional tools to perform such scans are very expensive and still produce many false positives.\nDynamic Code Analysis - tests are run against a working environment. A good way to search for vulnerabilities, which require all client- and server-side components to be present and running (like e.g. Cross-Site Scripting). Tests are performed in a semi-automated manner and require a proxy tool (like e.g. OWASP ZAP)\nUnit tests - self-written and self-maintained tests. They usually work on the HTTP/REST level (this defines the trust boundary between the client and the server) and run against a working environment. Unit tests are best suited for verifying requirements which involve business knowledge of the system or which assure secure configuration on the HTTP level.\nIn the current release of the Security Module, the main focus will be Unit Tests.\nAlthough the most common choice of environment for running security tests on will be integration(the environment offers the right stability and should mirror the production closely), it is not uncommon for some security tests to run on production as well. This is done for e.g. TLS configuration testing to ensure proper configuration of the most relevant environment in a continuous manner.\n"},{"id":974,"path":"../..\\..\\..\\..\\..\\xampp\\htdocs\\devonfw.github.io\\website\\pages\\docs/master-mrchecker.asciidoc_test-framework-modules.html#master-mrchecker.asciidoc_database-module","type":"docs","title":"Database Module","body":"78.7.

Mobile Test Module\nWhat is MrChecker E2E Mobile Test Module\nMrChecker E2E Mobile test Module is a suitable solution for testing Remote Web Design, Mobile Browsers and application.\nA user can write tests suitable for all mobile browsers with a full range of resolution. The way of working is similar to Selenium and uses the same rules and patterns as the Web Driver. For more information please look in the Selenium test module.\nWhat is Page Object Architecture\nCreating Selenium test cases can result in an unmaintainable project. One of the reasons is that too many duplicated code is used. Duplicated code could be caused by the duplicated functionality and this will result in duplicated usage of locators. The disadvantage of duplicated code is that the project is less maintainable. If some locator will change, you have to walk through the whole test code to adjust locators where necessary. By using the page object model we can make non-brittle test code and reduce or eliminate duplicate test code. Beside of that it improves the readability and allows us to create interactive documentation. Last but not least, we can create tests with less keystroke. An implementation of the page object model can be achieved by separating the abstraction of the test object and the test scripts.\nPage Object Pattern\nMobile Structure\nIt is build on the top of the Appium library.\nAppium is an open-source tool for automating native, mobile web, and hybrid applications on iOS mobile, Android mobile, and Windows desktop platforms. Native apps are those written using iOS, Android, or Windows SDKs. Mobile web apps are web apps accessed using a mobile browser (Appium supports Safari on iOS and Chrome or the built-in &apos;Browser&apos; app on Android). Hybrid apps have a wrapper around a &quot;webview&quot; - a native control that enables interaction with web content.\nRun on different mobile devices\nTo execute each test with chosen connected mobile devices, it is required to use specific arguments in Run configuration.\nDefault supported arguments in MrChecker:\ndeviceUrl - http url to Appium Server, default value &quot;http://127.0.0.1:4723&quot;\nautomationName - which automation engine to use , default value &quot;Appium&quot;\nplatformName - which mobile OS platform to use , default value &quot;Appium&quot;\nplatformVersion - mobile OS version , default value &quot;&quot;\ndeviceName - the kind of mobile device or emulator to use , default value &quot;Android Emulator&quot;\napp - the absolute local path or remote http URL to a .ipa file (IOS), .app folder (IOS Simulator), .apk file (Android) or .apks file (Android App Bundle), or a .zip file, default value &quot;.&quot;\nbrowserName - name of mobile web browser to automate. Should be an empty string if automating an app instead, default value &quot;&quot;\nnewCommandTimeout - how long (in seconds) Appium will wait for a new command from the client before assuming the client quit and ending the session, default value &quot;4000&quot;\ndeviceOptions - any other capabilites not covered in essential ones, default value none\nExample usage:\nmvn clean test -Dtest=MyTest -DdeviceUrl=&quot;http://192.168.0.1:1234&quot; -DplatformName=&quot;iOS&quot; -DdeviceName=&quot;iPhone Simulator&quot; -Dapp=&quot;.\\\\Simple_App.ipa&quot;\nmvn clean test -Dtest=MyTest -Dapp=&quot;.\\\\Simple_App.apk -DdeviceOptions=&quot;orientation=LANDSCAPE;appActivity=MainActivity;chromeOptions=[&apos;--disable-popup-blocking&apos;]&quot;\nCheck also:\n+\nMy First Selenium Test\n+\nHow to use Mobile test Module\n+\nExample TestCase\n+\nFull list of Generic Capabilities\n+\nList of additional capabilities for Android\n+\nList of additional capabilities for iOS\n"},{"id":978,"path":"../..\\..\\..\\..\\..\\xampp\\htdocs\\devonfw.github.io\\website\\pages\\docs/master-mrchecker.asciidoc_test-framework-modules.html#Mobile-Test-Module-How-to-use.asciidoc","type":"docs","title":"How to use mobile test Module","body":"78.8.2.

This solution makes configuration and maintenance very easy because everyone is able to manage versions and customize the configuration independently for each module. A separate security module ensures the protection of your credentials and assigned access roles regardless of changes in other modules.\nYour CI process will be matched to the current project. You can easily go back to the previous configuration, test a new one or move a selected one to other projects.\nDevOps module supports a delivery model in which executors are made available to the user as needed.

Continuous Integration\nEmbrace quality with Continuous Integration while you produce test case(s).\nOverview\nThere are two ways to set up your Continuous Integration environment:\nCreate a Jenkins instance from scratch (e.g. by using the Jenkins Docker image)\nUsing a clean Jenkins instance requires the installation of additional plugins. The plugins required and their versions can be found on this page.\nUse thre pre-configured custom Docker image provided by us\nNo more additional configuration is required (but optional) using this custom Docker image. Additionally, this Jenkins setup allows dynamical scaling across multiple machines and even cloud (AWS, Azure, Google Cloud etc.).\nJenkins Overview\nJenkins is an Open Source Continuous Integration Tool. It allows the user to create automated build jobs which will run remotely on so called Jenkins Slaves. A build job can be triggered by several events, for example on new pull request on specified repositories or timed (e.g. at midnight).\nJenking Configuration\nTests created by using the testing framework can easily be implemented on a Jenkins instance. The following chapter will describe such a job configuration. If you&#x2019;re running your own Jenkins instance, you may have to install additional plugins listed on the page Jenkins Plugins for a trouble-free integration of your tests.\nInitial Configuration\nThe test job is configured as a so-called parameterized job. This means, after starting the job, parameters can be specified, which will then be used in the build process. In this case, branch and testname will be expected when starting the job. These parameters specify which branch in the code repository should be checked out (possibly feature branch) and the name of the test that should be executed.\nBuild Process Configuration\nThe first step inside the build process configuration is to get the author of the commit that was made. The mail will be extracted and gets stored in a file called build.properties. This way, the author can be notified if the build fails.\nNext up, Maven will be used to check if the code can be compiled, without running any tests.\nAfter making sure that the code can be compiled, the actual tests will be executed.\nFinally, reports will be generated.\nPost Build Configuration\nAt first, the results will be imported to the Allure System\nJUnit test results will be reported as well. Using this step, the test result trend graph will be displayed on the Jenkins job overview.\nFinally, an E-Mail will be sent to the previously extracted author of the commit.\nUsing the Pre-Configured Custom Docker Image\nIf you are starting a new Jenkins instance for your tests, we&#x2019;d suggest using the pre-configured Docker image. This image already contains all the configurations and additional features.\nThe configurations are e.g. Plugins and Pre-Installed job setup samples. This way, you don&#x2019;t have to set up the entire CI-Environment from the ground up.\nAdditional features from this docker image allow dynamic creation and deletion of Jenkins slaves, by creating Docker containers. Also, Cloud Solutions can be implemented to allow wide-spread load balancing.\n"},{"id":982,"path":"../..\\..\\..\\..\\..\\xampp\\htdocs\\devonfw.github.io\\website\\pages\\docs/master-mrchecker.asciidoc_test-framework-modules.html#DevOPS-Test-Module-Continuous-Delivery-CD.asciidoc","type":"docs","title":"Continuous Delivery","body":"78.9.3.

Pipeline structure\nPipeline configuration:\nThe default interaction with Jenkins required manual jobs. This keeps configuration of a job in Jenkins separate from source code. With Pipeline plugin users can implement a pipeline procedure in Jenkinsfile and store it in repository with other code. This approach is used in Mr Checker framework. More info: https://jenkins.io/solutions/pipeline/\nOur CI &amp; CD processes are divided into a few separate files: Jenkins_node.groovy is the file to manage all processes. It defines all operations executed on a Jenkins node, so all code in this file is closed in node closure. Workflow in Jenkinsfile:\nRead all parameters from a Jenkins job\nExecute stage to prepare the environment\nExecute git pull command\nSet Jenkins job description\nExecute compilation of the project in a special prepared docker container\nExecute unit tests\nExecute integration tests\nDeploy artifacts to a local repository\nDeploy artifacts to an external repository (nexus/arifactory)\nNot all the steps must be present in the Jenkins files. This should be configured for particular job requirements.\nDescription of stages:\nStage &#x201C;Prepare environment&#x201D;\nFirst thing to do in this stage is overwriting properties loaded from Jenkins job. It is defined in &#x201C;overrideProperties&#x201D; function.

This is required beacuse when using pipeline plugin, Jenkins does not create the WORKSPACE env variables.\nStage &quot;Git pull&quot;\nIt pulls sources from the repository and loads &#x201C;git pull&#x201D; file which contains additional methods:\nsetGitAuthor &#x2013; setting properties about git author to the file &#x201C;build.properties&#x201D; and loading created file\ntryMergeWithBranch &#x2013; checking if actual branch can be merged with default main branch\nStage &#x201C;Build compile&#x201D;\nVerify with maven that code builds without errors\nStage &#x201C;Unit test&#x201D;\nExecute unit tests with mvn surefire test and publish reports in junit and allure format\nStage &#x201C;Integration test&#x201D;\nExecute integration tests with mvn surefire test and publish reports in junit and allure format\n[[devops-test-module-pipeline-structure.asciidoc_stage-deploy-&#x2013;-local-repo]]\n=== Stage &#x201C;Deploy &#x2013; local repo&#x201D;\nArchive artifacts as a jar file in the local repository\n[[devops-test-module-pipeline-structure.asciidoc_stage-deploy-&#x2013;-nexu-repo]]\n=== Stage &#x201D;Deploy &#x2013; nexu repo&#x201D;\nDeploy to the external repository with maven release deploy command with credentials stored in Jenkins machine.

Override all the required methods:\npublic class ABtestPage extends BasePage {\n@Override\npublic boolean isLoaded() {\ngetDriver().waitForPageLoaded();\nreturn getDriver().getCurrentUrl()\n.contains(PageSubURLsProjectYEnum.ABTEST.getValue());\n}\n@Override\npublic void load() {\nBFLogger.logDebug(&quot;Load &apos;A/B Test Control&apos; page.&quot;);\ngetDriver().get(GetEnvironmentParam.THE_INTERNET_MAIN_PAGE.getValue() +\nPageSubURLsProjectYEnum.ABTEST.getValue());\ngetDriver().waitForPageLoaded();\n}\n@Override\npublic String pageTitle() {\nreturn getActualPageTitle();\n}\n}\nHow to use Enum?\nSimilarly as in environmental variables case, create an enum for storing values of subURLs:\npublic enum PageSubURLsProjectYEnum {\nBASIC_AUTH(&quot;basic_auth&quot;),\nNEW_WINDOW(&quot;windows/new&quot;),\nWINDOW(&quot;windows&quot;),\nCHECKBOX(&quot;checkboxes&quot;),\nCONTEXT_MENU(&quot;context_menu&quot;),\nKEY_PRESS(&quot;key_presses&quot;),\nDYNAMIC_CONTENT(&quot;dynamic_content&quot;),\nHOVERS(&quot;hovers&quot;),\nSORTABLE_DATA_TABLES(&quot;tables&quot;),\nREDIRECT(&quot;redirector&quot;),\nJAVASCRIPT_ALERTS(&quot;javascript_alerts&quot;),\nCHALLENGING_DOM(&quot;challenging_dom&quot;),\nSTATUS_CODES(&quot;status_codes&quot;),\nLOGIN(&quot;login&quot;),\nABTEST(&quot;abtest&quot;),\nBROKEN_IMAGES(&quot;broken_images&quot;),\nDROPDOWN(&quot;dropdown&quot;),\nHORIZONTAL_SLIDER(&quot;horizontal_slider&quot;),\nDOWNLOAD(&quot;download&quot;),\nFORGOT_PASSWORD(&quot;forgot_password&quot;),\nFORGOT_PASSWORD_EMAIL_SENT(&quot;email_sent&quot;),\nEXIT_INTENT(&quot;exit_intent&quot;),\nDYNAMIC_LOADING(&quot;dynamic_loading&quot;),\nDISAPPEARING_ELEMENTS(&quot;disappearing_elements&quot;),\nDRAG_AND_DROP(&quot;drag_and_drop&quot;),\nDYNAMIC_CONTROLS(&quot;dynamic_controls&quot;),\nUPLOAD(&quot;upload&quot;),\nFLOATING_MENU(&quot;floating_menu&quot;),\nFRAMES(&quot;frames&quot;),\nGEOLOCATION(&quot;geolocation&quot;),\nINFINITE_SCROLL(&quot;infinite_scroll&quot;),\nJQUERY_UI(&quot;jqueryui/menu&quot;),\nJAVASCRIPT_ERROR(&quot;javascript_error&quot;),\nLARGE_AND_DEEP_DOM(&quot;large&quot;),\nNESTED_FRAMES(&quot;nested_frames&quot;),\nNOTIFICATION_MESSAGE(&quot;notification_message&quot;),\nDOWNLOAD_SECURE(&quot;download_secure&quot;),\nSHIFTING_CONTENT(&quot;shifting_content&quot;),\nSLOW_RESOURCES(&quot;slow&quot;),\nTYPOS(&quot;typos&quot;),\nWYSIWYGEDITOR(&quot;tinymce&quot;);\n/*\n* Sub URLs are used as real locations in the test environment\n*/\nprivate String subURL;\nprivate PageSubURLsProjectYEnum(String subURL) {\nthis.subURL = subURL;\n}\n;\nprivate PageSubURLsProjectYEnum() {\n}\n@Override\npublic String toString() {\nreturn getValue();\n}\npublic String getValue() {\nreturn subURL;\n}\n}\nInstead of mapping data from an external file, you can store and access them directly from the enum class:\nPageSubURLsProjectYEnum.ABTEST.getValue()\nSelector\nIn this test case you need selector for only one page element:\nprivate static final By elementalSeleniumLinkSelector = By.cssSelector(&quot;div &gt; div &gt; a&quot;);\nPage methods\nYou need two methods for performing page actions:\n/**\n* Clicks &apos;Elemental Selenium&apos; link at the bottom of the page.\n*\n* @return ElementalSeleniumPage object.\n*/\npublic ElementalSeleniumPage clickElementalSeleniumLink() {\ngetDriver().findElementDynamic(elementalSeleniumLinkSelector)\n.click();\ngetDriver().waitForPageLoaded();\nreturn new ElementalSeleniumPage();\n}\n/**\n* Switches window to the next one - different than the current.\n*/\npublic void switchToNextTab() {\nArrayList&lt;String&gt; tabsList = new ArrayList&lt;String&gt;(getDriver().getWindowHandles());\ngetDriver().switchTo()\n.window(tabsList.get(1));\n}\nElemental Selenium Page Class\nTo return new Elemental Selenium Page object, implement its class. You only need to write basic methods to check if the page is loaded. There is no need to interact with objects on the site:\npublic class ElementalSeleniumPage extends BasePage {\n@Override\npublic boolean isLoaded() {\ngetDriver().waitForPageLoaded();\nreturn getDriver().getCurrentUrl()\n.contains(GetEnvironmentParam.ELEMENTAL_SELENIUM_PAGE.getValue());\n}\n@Override\npublic void load() {\nBFLogger.logDebug(&quot;Load &apos;Elemental Selenium&apos; page.&quot;);\ngetDriver().get(GetEnvironmentParam.ELEMENTAL_SELENIUM_PAGE.getValue());\ngetDriver().waitForPageLoaded();\n}\n@Override\npublic String pageTitle() {\nreturn getActualPageTitle();\n}\n}\nTest Class\nCreate a Test class and write a @Test method to execute the scenario:\n@Category({ TestsSelenium.class, TestsChrome.class, TestsFirefox.class, TestsIE.class })\npublic class ABtestingTest extends TheInternetBaseTest {\nprivate static ABtestPage abTestPage;\n@Test\npublic void shouldOpenElementalSeleniumPageWhenClickElementalSeleniumLink() {\nlogStep(&quot;Click Elemental Selenium link&quot;);\nElementalSeleniumPage elementalSeleniumPage = abTestPage.clickElementalSeleniumLink();\nlogStep(&quot;Switch browser&apos;s tab to newly opened one&quot;);\nabTestPage.switchToNextTab();\nlogStep(&quot;Verify if Elemental Selenium Page is opened&quot;);\nassertTrue(&quot;Unable to open Elemental Selenium page&quot;, elementalSeleniumPage.isLoaded());\n}\n}\nAssert\nAsserts methods are used for creating test pass or fail conditions. The optional first parameter is a message which will be displayed in the test failure description.\nassertTrue(boolean condition) - test passes if condition returns true\nassertFalse(boolean condition) - test passes if condition returns false\nAlso, add the @BeforeClass method to open the tested page:\n@BeforeClass\npublic static void setUpBeforeClass() {\nabTestPage = shouldTheInternetPageBeOpened().clickABtestingLink();\nlogStep(&quot;Verify if ABTest page is opened&quot;);\nassertTrue(&quot;Unable to open ABTest page&quot;, abTestPage.isLoaded());\n}\n@BeforeClass method executes only once before all other\n@Test cases in the class. There is also a possibility to create a\n@AfterClass method which is performed also once after all @Test cases.\nYou don&#x2019;t need to implement @setUp and @tearDown methods because they&#x2019;re already in TheInternetBaseTest class which you extend.\nCategories\nYou can group tests in categories. It&#x2019;s useful when running many tests at once. Use this parameter:\n@Category({ TestsSelenium.class, TestsChrome.class, TestsFirefox.class, TestsIE.class })\nThen create an interface representing each category. Example:\npublic interface TestsSelenium {\n/* For test which are testing web pages considering UI (user interface) and using selenium webdriver */\n}\nTo run a test from specified category create Test Suite class:\n@RunWith(WildcardPatternSuite.class) //search for test files under /src/test/java\n@IncludeCategories({ TestsChrome.class }) // search all test files with category TestsChrome.class\n@ExcludeCategories({ TestsLocal.class, TestsNONParallel.class }) //exclude all test files with category TestsLocal.class and TestsNONParallel.class\n@SuiteClasses({ &quot;../**/*Test.class&quot; }) //search only test files, where file name ends with &lt;anyChar/s&gt;Test.class\npublic class _TestSuiteChrome {\n}\nYou can run a Test Suite as a JUnit test.\nIn this test case, the goal is to pass username and password authorization and login to the next page.\nSteps:\nOpen The Internet Main Page\nClick on Basic Auth link\nOpen pop-up login window\nEnter valid username and password\nOpen next subpage and verify if the user logged in successfully.\nPage Class\nCreate a page class which represents Basic Auth subpage after proper login.\nOverride all the required methods:\npublic class BasicAuthPage extends BasePage {\npublic BasicAuthPage() {\n}\npublic BasicAuthPage(String login, String password) {\nthis.enterLoginAndPasswordByUrl(login, password);\n}\n@Override\npublic boolean isLoaded() {\nreturn true;\n}\n@Override\npublic void load() {\nBFLogger.logDebug(&quot;load&quot;);\n}\n@Override\npublic String pageTitle() {\nreturn getActualPageTitle();\n}\nIn order to verify a login, create a selector to access the visible message.\nprivate static final By selectorTextMessage = By.cssSelector(&quot;#content &gt; div &gt; p&quot;);\nThen create a method to get message value:\n/**\n* Returns message displayed by system after user&apos;s log in.\n* @return String object representing message displayed by system after user&apos;s log in\n*/\npublic String getMessageValue() {\nreturn getDriver().findElementDynamic(selectorTextMessage)\n.getText();\n}\nAlso, create a method to access the pop-up login window and enter user credentials:\n/**\n* Authenticates user using standard simple authentication popup.\n*\n* @param login User&apos;s login\n* @param password User&apos;s password\n* @throws AWTException\n* @throws InterruptedException\n*/\npublic void enterLoginAndPassword(String login, String password) throws AWTException, InterruptedException {\nRobot rb = new Robot();\nThread.sleep(2000);\nStringSelection username = new StringSelection(login);\nToolkit.getDefaultToolkit()\n.getSystemClipboard()\n.setContents(username, null);\nrb.keyPress(KeyEvent.VK_CONTROL);\nrb.keyPress(KeyEvent.VK_V);\nrb.keyRelease(KeyEvent.VK_V);\nrb.keyRelease(KeyEvent.VK_CONTROL);\nrb.keyPress(KeyEvent.VK_TAB);\nrb.keyRelease(KeyEvent.VK_TAB);\nThread.sleep(2000);\nStringSelection pwd = new StringSelection(password);\nToolkit.getDefaultToolkit()\n.getSystemClipboard()\n.setContents(pwd, null);\nrb.keyPress(KeyEvent.VK_CONTROL);\nrb.keyPress(KeyEvent.VK_V);\nrb.keyRelease(KeyEvent.VK_V);\nrb.keyRelease(KeyEvent.VK_CONTROL);\nrb.keyPress(KeyEvent.VK_ENTER);\nrb.keyRelease(KeyEvent.VK_ENTER);\nThread.sleep(2000);\n}\nRobot class\nCreating a Robot object allows performing basic system actions such as pressing keys, moving the mouse or taking screenshots. In this case, it&#x2019;s used to paste login and password text from the clipboard using &apos;Ctrl + V&apos; shortcut, go to the next field using &apos;Tab&apos; key and submit by clicking &apos;Enter&apos;.\nToolkit\nStatic class Toolkit can perform basic window actions such as scrolling to a specified position or moving context between components. In this case, it&#x2019;s used to set clipboard content to username and password value.\nThread.sleep(long millis)\nWeb drivers like Selenium perform actions much faster than the normal user. This may cause unexpected consequences e.g. some elements may not be loaded before the driver wants to access them. To avoid this problem you can use Thread.sleep(long millis) to wait given time and let browser load wanted component.\nBEWARE: Using Thread.sleep(long millis) is not the recommended approach. Selenium driver gives methods to wait for a specified element to be enabled or visible with a timeout parameter. This is a more stable and effective way. Also, method waitForPageLoaded() will not solve that issue because it only waits for the ready state from the browser while some javascript actions might be performed after that.\nTest Class\nCreate a Test class and write a @Test method to execute the scenario. Save parameters as class fields:\n@Category({ TestsLocal.class, TestsNONParallel.class })\npublic class BasicAuthTest extends TheInternetBaseTest {\nprivate static BasicAuthPage basicAuthPage;\nprivate String login = &quot;admin&quot;;\nprivate String password = &quot;admin&quot;;\nprivate String message = &quot;Congratulations! You must have the proper credentials.&quot;;\n@Test\npublic void shouldUserLogInWithValidCredentials() throws InterruptedException, AWTException {\nbasicAuthPage = shouldTheInternetPageBeOpened().clickBasicAuthLink();\nlogStep(&quot;Enter login and password&quot;);\nbasicAuthPage.enterLoginAndPassword(login, password);\nlogStep(&quot;Verify if user logged in successfully&quot;);\nassertEquals(&quot;Unable to login user with valid credentials&quot;, message,\nbasicAuthPage.getMessageValue());\n}\n@Override\npublic void tearDown() {\nlogStep(&quot;Navigate back to The-Internet page&quot;);\ntheInternetPage.load();\n}\n}\nassertEquals(Object expected, Object actual) - test passes if parameters are equal .\nAlternative scenario:\nThere is also a possibility to log in with credentials as a part of URL: http://login:password@the-internet.herokuapp.com/basic_auth\nAnother page class method:\n/**\n* Authenticates user passing credentials into URL.\n*\n* @param login User&apos;s login\n* @param password User&apos;s password\n*/\nprivate void enterLoginAndPasswordByUrl(String login, String password) {\ngetDriver().get(&quot;http://&quot; + login + &quot;:&quot; + password + &quot;@&quot; + &quot;the-internet.herokuapp.com/&quot; +\nPageSubURLsProjectYEnum.BASIC_AUTH.getValue());\n}\nAnother test class method:\n@Test\npublic void shouldUserLogInWithValidCredentialsSetInURL() {\nlogStep(&quot;Enter user&apos;s credentials into URL to log in&quot;);\nbasicAuthPage = new BasicAuthPage(login, password);\nlogStep(&quot;Verify if user logged in successfully&quot;);\nassertEquals(&quot;Unable to login user with valid credentials&quot;, message,\nbasicAuthPage.getMessageValue());\n}\nAfter running test class as a JUnit test, both test cases will be performed.\nThis test goal is to check the dimensions of broken images on the subpage.\nSteps:\nOpen The Internet Main Page\nClick Broken Image link and go to Broken Image subpage\nGet the 3 images&apos; dimensions and compare them with expected values\nPage Class\nIn this case, create an array of selectors to access images by index number:\npublic class BrokenImagePage extends BasePage {\nprivate static final By[] selectorsImages = { By.cssSelector(&quot;div &gt; img:nth-child(2)&quot;),\nBy.cssSelector(&quot;div &gt; img:nth-child(3)&quot;),\nBy.cssSelector(&quot;div &gt; img:nth-child(4)&quot;) };\n@Override\npublic boolean isLoaded() {\ngetDriver().waitForPageLoaded();\nreturn getDriver().getCurrentUrl()\n.contains(PageSubURLsProjectYEnum.BROKEN_IMAGES.getValue());\n}\n@Override\npublic void load() {\nBFLogger.logDebug(&quot;Load &apos;Broken Images&apos; page.&quot;);\ngetDriver().get(GetEnvironmentParam.THE_INTERNET_MAIN_PAGE.getValue() +\nPageSubURLsProjectYEnum.BROKEN_IMAGES.getValue());\ngetDriver().waitForPageLoaded();\n}\n@Override\npublic String pageTitle() {\nreturn getActualPageTitle();\n}\n/**\n* Returns an image height in pixels.\n*\n* @param imageIndex An index of given image.\n* @return Height of an image in pixels.\n*/\npublic int getImageHeight(int imageIndex) {\nreturn getImageDimension(imageIndex).getHeight();\n}\n/**\n* Returns an image width in pixels.\n*\n* @param imageIndex An index of given image.\n* @return Width of an image in pixels.\n*/\npublic int getImageWidth(int imageIndex) {\nreturn getImageDimension(imageIndex).getWidth();\n}\nprivate Dimension getImageDimension(int imageIndex) {\nreturn getDriver().findElementDynamic(selectorsImages[imageIndex])\n.getSize();\n}\n}\nTest Class\nCreate @Test and @BeforeClass methods. Save expected images&apos; dimensions in class fields:\n@Category({ TestsSelenium.class, TestsChrome.class, TestsFirefox.class, TestsIE.class })\npublic class BrokenImagesTest extends TheInternetBaseTest {\nprivate static BrokenImagePage brokenImagePage;\nprivate final int expectedHeight = 90;\nprivate final int expectedWidth = 120;\n@BeforeClass\npublic static void setUpBeforeClass() {\nbrokenImagePage = shouldTheInternetPageBeOpened().clickBrokenImageLink();\nlogStep(&quot;Verify if Broken Image page is opened&quot;);\nassertTrue(&quot;Unable to open Broken Image page&quot;, brokenImagePage.isLoaded());\n}\n@Test\npublic void shouldImageSizesBeEqualToExpected() {\nfor (int i = 0; i &lt; 3; i++) {\nlogStep(&quot;Verify size of image with index: &quot; + i);\nassertEquals(&quot;Height of image with index: &quot; + i + &quot; is incorrect&quot;, expectedHeight,\nbrokenImagePage.getImageHeight(i));\nassertEquals(&quot;Width of image with index: &quot; + i + &quot; is incorrect&quot;, expectedWidth,\nbrokenImagePage.getImageWidth(i));\n}\n}\n}\nThe test will pass if every image had the correct width and height.\nThis case goal is to find out how to create stable selectors.\nIn the browser&#x2019;s developer mode, you can see how the page is built. Notice, that buttons&apos; IDs change after click and values in the table haven&#x2019;t got unique attributes, which might be helpful in order to find them.\nDOM - Document Object Model\nHTML DOM is a model of the page created by the browser. The page could be represented as the tree of objects. Read more.\nTo create locators you can use element attributes such as id, class name etc.\nIt this case, since there are no unique attributes, the best approach is to use HTML document structure and identify page elements by their place in an object hierarchy.\nPage Class\npublic class ChallengingDomPage extends BasePage {\nprivate final By selectorTableRows = By.cssSelector(&quot;.large-10 &gt; table &gt; tbody &gt; tr&quot;);\nprivate final By selectorFirstButton = By.cssSelector(&quot;.large-2.columns &gt; .button:nth-\nchild(1)&quot;);\n@Override\npublic boolean isLoaded() {\ngetDriver().waitForPageLoaded();\nreturn getDriver().getCurrentUrl()\n.contains(PageSubURLsProjectYEnum.CHALLENGING_DOM.getValue());\n}\n@Override\npublic void load() {\nBFLogger.logDebug(&quot;Load &apos;Challenging DOM&apos; page.&quot;);\ngetDriver().get(GetEnvironmentParam.THE_INTERNET_MAIN_PAGE.getValue() +\nPageSubURLsProjectYEnum.CHALLENGING_DOM.getValue());\ngetDriver().waitForPageLoaded();\n}\n@Override\npublic String pageTitle() {\nreturn getActualPageTitle();\n}\n/**\n* Returns table text content as a list of String objects.\n*\n* @return A list of table values.\n*/\npublic List&lt;String&gt; getTableValues() {\nreturn JsoupHelper.findTexts(selectorTableRows);\n}\n/**\n* Clicks top button on the page from available button set.\n*/\npublic void clickFirstButton() {\ngetDriver().elementButton(selectorFirstButton)\n.click();\ngetDriver().waitForPageLoaded();\n}\n}\nJsoup Helper\nJsoup Helper is the tool which helps to parse HTML document and get searched values. This is especially useful when values are organized in a generic structure such as a table.\nJsoupHelper.findTexts(By selector) - this method returns text content of a table as a list of Strings\nTest Class\nSteps:\nOpen The Internet Main Page\nClick Challenging DOM link and go to Challenging DOM subpage\nGet and save table values\nClick the first button\nGet table values again\nCompare table values before and after button click\n@Category({ TestsSelenium.class, TestsChrome.class, TestsFirefox.class, TestsIE.class })\npublic class ChallengingDomTest extends TheInternetBaseTest {\nprivate static ChallengingDomPage challengingDomPage;\n@BeforeClass\npublic static void setUpBeforeClass() {\nchallengingDomPage = shouldTheInternetPageBeOpened().clickChallengingDomLink();\nlogStep(&quot;Verify if Challenging Dom page is opened&quot;);\nassertTrue(&quot;Unable to open Challenging Dom page&quot;, challengingDomPage.isLoaded());\n}\n@Test\npublic void shouldValuesInTableCellsStayUnchangedAfterClick() {\nlogStep(&quot;Get table values (before click any button)&quot;);\nList&lt;String&gt; tableValuesBeforeClick = challengingDomPage.getTableValues();\nlogStep(&quot;Click first button&quot;);\nchallengingDomPage.clickFirstButton();\nlogStep(&quot;Get table values (after click first button)&quot;);\nList&lt;String&gt; tableValuesAfterClick = challengingDomPage.getTableValues();\nlogStep(&quot;Verify equality of table values before and after click&quot;);\nassertEquals(&quot;Values from table cells were changed after click&quot;, tableValuesBeforeClick,\ntableValuesAfterClick);\n}\n}\nBecause values in the table don&#x2019;t change, the test should pass if object locators are solid.\nIn this example, you will learn how to test checkboxes on the page.\nA checkbox is a simple web element which can be selected or unselected by clicking on it.\nSteps:\nOpen The Internet Main Page\nClick Checkboxes link and go to Checkboxes page\nTest if the first checkbox is unchecked\nSelect the first checkbox\nTest if the first checkbox is checked\nTest if the second checkbox is checked\nUnselect second checkbox\nTest if the second checkbox is unchecked\nPage Class\nBecause both checkboxes are in one form, it&#x2019;s possible to locate them by one selector and then access each individual one by index.\npublic class CheckboxesPage extends BasePage {\nprivate final static By checkboxesFormSelector = By.cssSelector(&quot;#checkboxes&quot;);\n@Override\npublic boolean isLoaded() {\ngetDriver().waitForPageLoaded();\nreturn getDriver().getCurrentUrl()\n.contains(PageSubURLsProjectYEnum.CHECKBOX.getValue());\n}\n@Override\npublic void load() {\nBFLogger.logDebug(&quot;Load &apos;Checkboxes&apos; page.&quot;);\ngetDriver().get(GetEnvironmentParam.THE_INTERNET_MAIN_PAGE.getValue() +\nPageSubURLsProjectYEnum.CHECKBOX.getValue());\ngetDriver().waitForPageLoaded();\n}\n@Override\npublic String pageTitle() {\nreturn getActualPageTitle();\n}\n/**\n* Verifies if checkbox form is visible on the page.\n*\n* @return true if checkboxes are present and displayed on the page\n*/\npublic boolean isElementCheckboxesFormVisible() {\nreturn getDriver().elementCheckbox(checkboxesFormSelector)\n.isDisplayed();\n}\n/**\n* Verifies if given checkbox is selected or not.\n*\n* @param index The index of given checkbox\n* @return true if given checkbox is selected\n*/\npublic boolean isCheckboxSelected(int index) {\nreturn getDriver().elementCheckbox(checkboxesFormSelector)\n.isCheckBoxSetByIndex(index);\n}\n/**\n* Selects given checkbox. Unselects, if it is already selected.\n*\n* @param index The index of given checkbox\n*/\npublic void selectCheckbox(int index) {\nCheckBox checkbox = getDriver().elementCheckbox(checkboxesFormSelector);\nif (isCheckboxSelected(index)) {\ncheckbox.unsetCheckBoxByIndex(index);\n} else {\ncheckbox.setCheckBoxByIndex(index);\n}\n}\n}\nCheckBox\nCheckBox class contains a method to perform actions on checkboxes such as setting and unsetting or verifying if the specified box is checked.\nUse method elementCheckbox(By selector) to create CheckBox Object.\nTest Class\n@Category({ TestsSelenium.class, TestsChrome.class, TestsFirefox.class, TestsIE.class })\npublic class CheckboxesTest extends TheInternetBaseTest {\nprivate static CheckboxesPage checkboxesPage;\n@Override\npublic void setUp() {\ncheckboxesPage = shouldTheInternetPageBeOpened().clickCheckboxesLink();\nlogStep(&quot;Verify if Checkboxes page is opened&quot;);\nassertTrue(&quot;Unable to open Checkboxes page&quot;, checkboxesPage.isLoaded());\n}\n@Test\npublic void shouldCheckboxBeSelectedAfterClick() {\nlogStep(&quot;Verify if first checkbox is not selected&quot;);\nassertFalse(&quot;The checkbox is selected&quot;, checkboxesPage.isCheckboxSelected(0));\nlogStep(&quot;Select first checkbox&quot;);\ncheckboxesPage.selectCheckbox(0);\nlogStep(&quot;Verify if first checkbox is selected&quot;);\nassertTrue(&quot;The checkbox is not selected&quot;, checkboxesPage.isCheckboxSelected(0));\n}\n@Test\npublic void shouldCheckboxBeUnselectedAfterClick() {\nlogStep(&quot;Verify if second checkbox is selected&quot;);\nassertTrue(&quot;The checkbox is not selected&quot;, checkboxesPage.isCheckboxSelected(1));\nlogStep(&quot;Select second checkbox&quot;);\ncheckboxesPage.selectCheckbox(1);\nlogStep(&quot;Verify if second checkbox is not selected&quot;);\nassertFalse(&quot;The checkbox is selected&quot;, checkboxesPage.isCheckboxSelected(1));\n}\n}\nAfter running Test Class both @Test cases will be performed. Before each one, overrode setUp method will be executed.\nThis case will show how to test changing website content.\nAfter refreshing page (F5) a few times, a new element should appear:\nThen, after another couple of refreshes, it should disappear.\nYou can check in developer mode that Gallery element does not exist in HTML document either, until appearing on the page. The element is created by Javascript.\nSteps:\nLoad The Internet Main Page\nClick Disappearing Elements link and go to that subpage\nCheck if Menu Buttons exist on the page\nRefresh the page until a new element appears\nCheck if Gallery Button exists\nCheck if the number of buttons equals the expected value\nRefresh the page until an element disappears\nCheck if Gallery Button does not exist\nCheck if the number of buttons is smaller than before\nPage Class\npublic class DisappearingElementsPage extends BasePage {\nprivate static final By selectorGalleryMenuButton = By.cssSelector(&quot;li &gt; a[href*=gallery]&quot;);\nprivate static final By selectorMenuButtons = By.cssSelector(&quot;li&quot;);\n@Override\npublic boolean isLoaded() {\ngetDriver().waitForPageLoaded();\nreturn getDriver().getCurrentUrl()\n.contains(PageSubURLsProjectYEnum.DISAPPEARING_ELEMENTS.getValue());\n}\n@Override\npublic void load() {\nBFLogger.logDebug(&quot;Load &apos;Disappearing Elements&apos; page.&quot;);\ngetDriver().get(GetEnvironmentParam.THE_INTERNET_MAIN_PAGE.getValue() +\nPageSubURLsProjectYEnum.DISAPPEARING_ELEMENTS.getValue());\ngetDriver().waitForPageLoaded();\n}\n@Override\npublic String pageTitle() {\nreturn getActualPageTitle();\n}\n/**\n* Returns a number of WebElements representing menu buttons.\n*\n* @return A number of WebElements.\n*/\npublic int getNumberOfMenuButtons() {\nreturn getDriver().findElementDynamics(selectorMenuButtons)\n.size();\n}\n/**\n* Returns WebElement representing disappearing element of menu.\n*\n* @return Disappearing WebElement if visible, null otherwise.\n*/\npublic WebElement getGalleryMenuElement() {\nreturn getDriver().findElementQuietly(selectorGalleryMenuButton);\n}\n/**\n* Refreshes web page as many times as it is required to appear/disappear menu button\n* WebElement.\n*\n* @param shouldAppear Determines if element should appear (true) or disappear (false).\n*/\npublic void refreshPageUntilWebElementAppears(boolean shouldAppear) {\nint numberOfAttempts = 5;\nint counter = 0;\nwhile (!isVisibilityAsExpected(shouldAppear) || isMaxNumberOfAttemptsReached(counter++,\nnumberOfAttempts)) {\nrefreshPage();\n}\n}\n/**\n* Verify if visibility of Gallery button is the same as expected\n*\n* @param expected Determines if element should be visible (true) or not visible (false).\n*/\nprivate boolean isVisibilityAsExpected(boolean expected) {\nboolean isVisibilityDifferentThanExpected = isGalleryMenuElementVisible() ^ expected;\nreturn !isVisibilityDifferentThanExpected;\n}\nprivate boolean isGalleryMenuElementVisible() {\nboolean result = false;\nWebElement gallery = getGalleryMenuElement();\nif (gallery != null)\nresult = gallery.isDisplayed();\nreturn result;\n}\nprivate boolean isMaxNumberOfAttemptsReached(int attemptNo, int maxNumberOfAttempts) {\nreturn attemptNo == maxNumberOfAttempts;\n}\n}\nfindElementQuietly(By selector) works similar as findElementDynamics(By selector) but won&#x2019;t throw an exception if an element wasn&#x2019;t found.

It also hides window after clicking &quot;Close&quot;.\nPage Class\npublic class ExitIntentPage extends BasePage {\nprivate static final String MODAL_WINDOW_HIDDEN = &quot;display: none;&quot;;\nprivate static final String MODAL_WINDOW_DISPLAYED = &quot;display: block;&quot;;\nprivate static final String MODAL_WINDOW_STYLE_ATTRIBUTTE = &quot;style&quot;;\nprivate static final By selectorModalWindow = By.cssSelector(&quot;div#ouibounce-modal&quot;);\nprivate static final By selectorExitIntentText = By.cssSelector(&quot;div#content h3&quot;);\nprivate static final By selectorModalWindowTitle = By.cssSelector(&quot;h3&quot;);\nprivate static final By selectorModalWindowCloseButton = By.cssSelector(&quot;div.modal-footer &gt; p&quot;);\n@Override\npublic boolean isLoaded() {\ngetDriver().waitForPageLoaded();\nreturn getDriver().getCurrentUrl()\n.contains(PageSubURLsProjectYEnum.EXIT_INTENT.getValue());\n}\n@Override\npublic void load() {\nBFLogger.logDebug(&quot;Load &apos;Exit Intent&apos; page.&quot;);\ngetDriver().get(GetEnvironmentParam.THE_INTERNET_MAIN_PAGE.getValue() +\nPageSubURLsProjectYEnum.EXIT_INTENT.getValue());\ngetDriver().waitForPageLoaded();\n}\n@Override\npublic String pageTitle() {\nreturn getActualPageTitle();\n}\n/**\n* Returns information if exit intent message is visible or not.\n*\n* @return true if exit intent message was found on web page.\n*/\npublic boolean isIntentMessageVisible() {\nreturn getDriver().findElementDynamic(selectorExitIntentText)\n.isDisplayed();\n}\n/**\n* Returns information if modal window is hidden.\n*\n* @return true if modal window is hidden.\n*/\npublic boolean isModalWindowHidden() {\nreturn getDriver().findElementDynamic(selectorModalWindow)\n.getAttribute(MODAL_WINDOW_STYLE_ATTRIBUTTE)\n.equals(MODAL_WINDOW_HIDDEN);\n}\n/**\n* Returns information if modal window is showed on web page.\n*\n* @return true if modal window is displayed.\n*/\npublic boolean isModalWindowVisible() {\nreturn getDriver().findElementDynamic(selectorModalWindow)\n.getAttribute(MODAL_WINDOW_STYLE_ATTRIBUTTE)\n.equals(MODAL_WINDOW_DISPLAYED);\n}\n/**\n* Returns information if modal window title is shown and correct.\n*\n* @param expectedValue String representing expected value of modal window&apos;s title.\n* @return true if modal window&apos;s title is equal to expected value.\n*/\npublic boolean verifyModalWindowTitle(String expectedValue) {\nreturn getDriver().elementLabel(new ByChained(selectorModalWindow,\nselectorModalWindowTitle))\n.getText()\n.equals(expectedValue);\n}\n/**\n* Closes modal window by pressing &apos;close&apos; button.\n*/\npublic void closeModalWindow() {\ngetDriver().elementButton(new ByChained(selectorModalWindow,\nselectorModalWindowCloseButton))\n.click();\n}\n/**\n* Moves mouse pointer to the top middle of screen, then to the centre of screen and\n* again to the top.\n* &lt;p&gt;\n* This move simulates leaving the viewport and encourages the modal to show up.

In this case attribute &quot;style&quot; determinates if the element is displayed.\nRobot\nRobot class can perform mouse movement. Method mouseMove(int x, int y) moves the remote mouse to given coordinates.\nManage Timeouts\nmanage().timeouts() methods allows you to change WebDriver timeouts values such as:\npageLoadTimeout(long time, TimeUnit unit) - the amount of time to wait for a page to load before throwing an exception\nsetScriptTimeout(long time, TimeUnit unit) - the amount of time to wait for finish execution of a script before throwing an exception\nimplicitlyWait(long time, TimeUnit unit) - the amount of time the driver should wait when searching for an element if it is not immediately present. After that time, it throws an exception.\nChanging timeouts can improve test stability but can also make them run slower.\nTest Class\nSteps:\nOpen The Internet Main Page\nClick Exit Intent link and load subpage\nCheck if the page is loaded and &quot;Exit Intent&quot; message is visible\nVerify if Modal Window is hidden\nMove mouse out of the viewport\nCheck if Modal Window is visible\nVerify if Modal Window title is correct\nClick &apos;close&apos; button\nAgain verify if Modal Window is hidden\n@Category({ TestsLocal.class, TestsNONParallel.class })\npublic class ExitIntentTest extends TheInternetBaseTest {\nprivate static final String MODAL_WINDOW_TITLE = &quot;This is a modal window&quot;;\nprivate static ExitIntentPage exitIntentPage;\n@BeforeClass\npublic static void setUpBeforeClass() {\nexitIntentPage = shouldTheInternetPageBeOpened().clickExitIntentLink();\nlogStep(&quot;Verify if Exit Intent page is opened&quot;);\nassertTrue(&quot;Unable to open Exit Intent page&quot;, exitIntentPage.isLoaded());\nlogStep(&quot;Verify if exit intent message is visible&quot;);\nassertTrue(&quot;Exit intent message is not visible&quot;, exitIntentPage.isIntentMessageVisible());\n}\n@Test\npublic void shouldModalWindowAppearWhenMouseMovedOutOfViewportTest() {\nlogStep(&quot;Verify if modal window is hidden&quot;);\nassertTrue(&quot;Fail to hide modal window&quot;, exitIntentPage.isModalWindowHidden());\nlogStep(&quot;Move mouse pointer out of viewport&quot;);\nexitIntentPage.moveMouseOutOfViewport();\nlogStep(&quot;Verify if modal window showed up&quot;);\nassertTrue(&quot;Fail to show up modal window&quot;, exitIntentPage.isModalWindowVisible());\nlogStep(&quot;Verify if modal window title displays properly&quot;);\nassertTrue(&quot;Fail to display modal window&apos;s title&quot;,\nexitIntentPage.verifyModalWindowTitle(MODAL_WINDOW_TITLE.toUpperCase()));\nlogStep(&quot;Close modal window&quot;);\nexitIntentPage.closeModalWindow();\nlogStep(&quot;Verify if modal window is hidden again&quot;);\nassertTrue(&quot;Fail to hide modal window&quot;, exitIntentPage.isModalWindowHidden());\n}\n}\nRemember not to move mouse manually during test execution.\nThis example shows how to check if file downloads properly.\nAfter clicking on one of these links, a specific file should be downloaded to your computer.\nSteps:\nOpen The Internet Main Page\nClick on the File Download link and open subpage\nClick on &quot;some-file.txt&quot; download link and download file\nCheck if the file exists in the appropriate folder\nDelete the file\nCheck if the file doesn&#x2019;t exist in the folder\nPage Class\npublic class FileDownloadPage extends BasePage {\nprivate static final By selectorSomeFileTxt = By.cssSelector(&quot;a[href*=some-file]&quot;);\nprivate final String DOWNLOAD_DIR = System.getProperty(&quot;java.io.tmpdir&quot;);\n@Override\npublic boolean isLoaded() {\ngetDriver().waitForPageLoaded();\nreturn getDriver().getCurrentUrl()\n.contains(PageSubURLsProjectYEnum.DOWNLOAD.getValue());\n}\n@Override\npublic void load() {\nBFLogger.logDebug(&quot;Load &apos;File Downloader&apos; page.&quot;);\ngetDriver().get(GetEnvironmentParam.THE_INTERNET_MAIN_PAGE.getValue() +\nPageSubURLsProjectYEnum.DOWNLOAD.getValue());\ngetDriver().waitForPageLoaded();\n}\n@Override\npublic String pageTitle() {\nreturn getActualPageTitle();\n}\n/**\n* Verifies if the chosen file is already downloaded and if not, downloads it .\n* Throws RuntimeException otherwise.\n*\n* @return Downloaded file\n*/\npublic File downloadTextFile() {\nString nameOfDownloadFile = getNameOfDownloadFile();\nFile fileToDownload = new File(DOWNLOAD_DIR + nameOfDownloadFile);\nif (fileToDownload.exists()) {\nthrow new RuntimeException(&quot;The file that you want to download already exists. &quot;\n+ &quot;Please remove it manually.

MrChecker E2E tutorials\nIn order to learn more about MrChecker structure, start from Project Organisation section and then check out our fantastic tutorials:\nHow to create a basic test in MrChecker\nExample: Booking a table\nAs an example to test we will use MyThaiStar booking page.\nIn order to book a table, do the following steps:\nOpen MyThaiStar Book Table Page\nEnter booking data: Date and time, Name, Email and number of Table guests\nClick Accept terms\nClick Book table\nDisplay confirmation box and send booking\nCheck if the booking was successful.\nYou can go through these steps manually and doublecheck the result.\nHow to prepare a test\n1. Create BookTablePage class\nYou will need a class which will represent MyThaiStart booking page.\nFill the required methods with the following code:\npublic class BookTablePage extends BasePage {\n@Override\npublic boolean isLoaded() {\ngetDriver().waitForPageLoaded(); //waits untli the page is loaded\nreturn getDriver().getCurrentUrl()\n.equals(&quot;http://de-mucdevondepl01:8090/bookTable&quot;); //checks if current page address equals MyThaiStar booking page adress\n}\n@Override\npublic void load() {\ngetDriver().get(&quot;http://de-mucdevondepl01:8090/bookTable&quot;); //loads page under specified adress\ngetDriver().waitForPageLoaded(); //waits until the page is loaded\n}\n@Override\npublic String pageTitle() {\nreturn &quot;My Thai Star&quot;; //returns page title\n}\n}\ngetDriver() method allows accessing Selenium Web Driver which performs actions on the webpage.\nAs this page class represents the MyThaiStar booking page, you have to set up selectors for web elements required in the test case. In the example you have to create selectors for elements we&#x2019;ll interact with:\nDate and time input field\nName input field\nEmail input field\nTable guests input field\nAccept terms checkbox\nBook table button\nSelectors will be implemented as fields.\nExample of the selector for Date and time input field:\n/** Date field search criteria */\nprivate static final By dateSearch = By.cssSelector(&quot;input[formcontrolname=&apos;bookingDate&apos;]&quot;);\nThe input field&#x2019;s name &quot;bookingDate&quot; was found by using the developer console in Google Chrome. How to prepare an everlasting selector?\nThis selector can be used to create a WebElement object of the said input field. Therefore, you will create a new method and call it &quot;enterTimeAndDate&quot;.\npublic void enterTimeAndDate(String date) {\nWebElement dateInput = getDriver().findElementDynamic(dateSearch); //creates a new WebElement to access Date and time input field\ndateInput.sendKeys(date); //enters date value\n}\nNow you can create other selectors and objects and methods for every element on the webpage:\n/** Name input field search criteria */\nprivate static final By nameSearch = By.cssSelector(&quot;input[formcontrolname=&apos;name&apos;]&quot;);\n/** Email input field search criteria */\nprivate static final By emailSearch = By.cssSelector(&quot;input[formcontrolname=&apos;email&apos;]&quot;);\n/** Number of guests search criteria */\nprivate static final By guestsSearch = By.cssSelector(&quot;input[formcontrolname=&apos;assistants&apos;]&quot;);\n/** Check box search criteria */\nprivate static final By checkboxSearch = By.cssSelector(&quot;mat-checkbox[data-name=&apos;bookTableTerms&apos;]&quot;);\n/** Book table button search criteria */\nprivate static By bookTableSearch = By.name(&quot;bookTableSubmit&quot;);\npublic void enterName(String name) {\nWebElement nameInput = getDriver().findElementDynamic(nameSearch); //creates a new WebElement to access name input field\nnameInput.sendKeys(name); //enters name value\n}\npublic void enterEmail(String email) {\nWebElement emailInput = getDriver().findElementDynamic(emailSearch); //creates a new WebElement to access email input field\nemailInput.sendKeys(email); //enters email value\n}\npublic void enterGuests(int amountOfGuests) {\nWebElement guestsInput = getDriver().findElementDynamic(guestsSearch); //creates a new WebElement to access amount of guests input field\nguestsInput.sendKeys(Integer.toString(amountOfGuests)); //enters the number of guests value converted from integer to string\n}\npublic void acceptTerms() {\nWebElement checkbox = getDriver().findElementDynamic(checkboxSearch); //creates aa new WebElement to access accept terms checkbox\nWebElement square = checkbox.findElement(By.className(&quot;mat-checkbox-inner-container&quot;)); //creates a new WebElement to access inner square\nJavascriptExecutor js = (JavascriptExecutor) getDriver(); //creates a Javascript executor object\njs.executeScript(&quot;arguments[0].click()&quot;, square); //executes a script which clicks the square\n}\npublic void clickBookTable() {\nWebElement buttonbutton = getDriver().findElementDynamic(bookTableSearch); //creates a new WebElement to access book table button\ngetDriver().waitUntilElementIsClickable(bookTableSearch); //waits until a button might be clicked\nbuttonbutton.click(); //clicks the button\n}\nYou can use those methods in order to create a new method to go through the whole booking process:\npublic ConfirmBookPage enterBookingData(String date, String name, String email, int guests) {\nenterTimeAndDate(date);\nenterName(name);\nenterEmail(email);\nenterGuests(guests);\nacceptTerms();\nclickBookTable();\nreturn new ConfirmBookPage();\n}\n2. Create ConfirmBookPage class\nAs you can see, this method returns another page object that has not yet been created. This step is required, as the booking information that you would like to check is on another webpage. This means that you will have to create another page class and call it ConfirmBookPage:\npublic class ConfirmBookPage extends BasePage {\n/** Confirmation dialog search criteria */\nprivate static final By confirmationDialogSearch = By.className(&quot;mat-dialog-container&quot;);\n/** Send confirmation button search criteria */\nprivate static final By sendButtonSearch = By.name(&quot;bookTableConfirm&quot;);\n/** Cancel confirmation button search criteria */\nprivate static final By cancelButtonSearch = By.name(&quot;bookTableCancel&quot;);\n@Override\npublic boolean isLoaded() {\n//creates a new WebElement to access confirmation dialog box\nWebElement confirmationDialog = getDriver().findElementDynamic(confirmationDialogSearch);\nreturn confirmationDialog.isDisplayed(); //checks if the box is displayed\n}\n//this method won&apos;t be called because the page is loaded only after clicking book table button\n@Override\npublic void load() {\nBFLogger.logError(&quot;MyThaiStar booking confirmation page was not loaded.&quot;); //logs error\n}\n@Override\npublic String pageTitle() {\nreturn &quot;My Thai Star&quot;;\n}\npublic void confirmBookingData() {\nWebElement sendButton = getDriver().findElementDynamic(sendButtonSearch); //creates a new WebElement to access confirmation button\nsendButton.click(); //clicks the send button\n}\npublic void cancelBookingData() {\nWebElement cancelButton = getDriver().findElementDynamic(cancelButtonSearch); //creates a new WebElement to access resignation button\ncancelButton.click(); //clicks the cancel button\n}\n}\nAfter the click on Send button - the green confirmation dialogue appears with the message &quot;Table successfully booked&quot;:\nTo be able to check if the booking was successful, you should go back to the BookTablePage class and add one more method in order to check if the green box was displayed:\n/** Dialog search criteria */\nprivate static final By dialogSearch = By.className(&quot;bgc-green-600&quot;);\npublic boolean checkConfirmationDialog() {\nWebElement greenConfirmationDialog = getDriver().findElementDynamic(dialogSearch); //creates a new WebElement to access confirmation dialog\nreturn greenConfirmationDialog.isDisplayed(); //checks if the dialog is displayed\n}\n3. Create BookTableTest class\nAt this point you can start creating a test class:\nimport static org.junit.Assert.assertTrue;\npublic class BookTableTest extends BaseTest {\nprivate static BookTablePage bookTablePage = new BookTablePage(); //the field contains book table page object\n@BeforeClass\npublic static void setUpBeforeClass() {\nbookTablePage.load(); //loads book table page\n}\n@AfterClass\npublic static void tearDownAfterClass() {\n}\n@Override\npublic void setUp() {\nif (!bookTablePage.isLoaded()) {\nbookTablePage.load(); //if the page is not loaded, loads it\n}\n}\n@Override\npublic void tearDown() {\n}\n}\n4. Write the first test\nYou can prepare our first test method using the methods from page classes\n@Test\npublic void Test_BookTableAndCheckConfirmation() {\nString date = &quot;07/23/2019 1:00 PM&quot;; //replace with tommorow&apos;s date in format &quot;MM/dd/yyyy hh:mm a&quot;\nString name = &quot;Smith&quot;; //name field\nString email = &quot;smith@somemail.com&quot;; //email field\nint guests = 3; //number of guests\n//enters booking data and returns a new confirmation page\nConfirmBookPage confirmBookPage = bookTablePage.enterBookingData(date, name, email, guests);\nconfirmBookPage.confirmBookingData(); //confirms booking\n//checks if the green dialog box appears, if it does, test is passed, if not, the test failed and displays message given in the first argument\nassertTrue(&quot;Test failed: Table not booked&quot;, bookTablePage.checkConfirmationDialog()); //returns true if dialog box appears and false if not\n}\n5.

Angular CI\nThe Angular client-side of My Thai Star is going to have some specific needs for the CI-CD Pipeline to perform mandatory operations.\nPipeline\nThe Pipeline for the Angular client-side is going to be called MyThaiStar_FRONTEND_BUILD. It is located in the PL instance, under the MTS folder (as previously explained). It is going to follow a process flow like this one:\nEach of those steps are called stages in the Jenkins context.Let&#x2019;s see what those steps mean in the context of the Angular application:\nDeclarative: Checkout SCM\nRetrieves the project from the GitHub repository which it&#x2019;s located. This step is not defined directly in our pipeline, but as it is loaded from the repository this step should always be done at the beginning.\nDeclarative: Tool Install\nThe Pipeline needs some Tools to perform some operations with the Angular project. These tool is a correct version of NodeJS (10.17.0 LTS) with Yarn installed as global package.\ntools {\nnodejs &quot;NodeJS 10.14.0&quot;\n}\nLoading Custom Tools\nThe Pipeline also needs a browser in order to execute the tests, so in this step the chrome-stable will be loaded. We will use it in a headless mode.\ntool chrome\nFresh Dependency Installation\nThe script $ yarn does a package installation. As we always clean the workspace after the pipeline, all packages must be installed in every execution.\nCode Linting\nThis script executes a linting process of TypeScript. Rules can be defined in the tslint.json file of the project. It throws an exception whenever a file contains a non-compliant piece of code.\nExecute Angular tests\nThe CI testing of the Angular client is different than the standard local testing (adapted to CI environments, as specified in the Adaptation section of document). This script just executes the following commands:\nng test --browsers ChromeHeadless --watch=false\nCheck dependencies\nBefore continue, we print the result of yarn audit. It shows the vulnerabilities in the dependencies. It do not process the reponse. The purpose is only to track the result of the command.\nyarn audit\nSonarQube code analysis\nThe script load and execute the tool sonar-scanner. This tool is loaded here because it&#x2019;s not used in any other part of the pipeline. The sonar-scanner will take all code, upload it to sonarQube and wait until sonarQube send us a response with the quality of our code. If the code do not pass the quality gate, the pipeline will stop at this point.\nBuild Application\nThe building process of the Angular client would result in a folder called /dist in the main Angular&#x2019;s directory. That folder is the one that is going to be served afterwards as an artifact. This process has also been adapted to some Deployment needs. This building script executes the following:\nng build --configuration=docker\nDeliver application into Nexus\nOnce the scripts produce the Angular artifact (/dist folder), it&#x2019;s time to package it and store into nexus.\nDeclarative: Post Actions\nAt the end, this step is always executed, even if a previous stage fail. We use this step to clean up the workspace for future executions\npost {\nalways {\ncleanWs()\n}\n}\nAdjustments\nThe Angular project Pipeline needed some &quot;extra&quot; features to complete all planned processes. Those features resulted in some additions to the project.\nPipeline Environment\nIn order to easily reuse the pipeline in other angular projects, all variables have been defined in the block environment. All variables have the default values that Production Line uses, so if you&#x2019;re going to work in production line you won&#x2019;t have to change anything. Example:\nenvironment {\n// Script for build the application. Defined at package.json\nbuildScript = &apos;build --configuration=docker&apos;\n// Script for lint the application.

Deployment Strategies\nIn this chapter different way of deploying My Thai Star are explained. Everything will be based in Docker.\nIndependent Docker containers\nThe first way of deployment will use isolated Docker containers. That means that if the client-side container is deployed, it does not affect the server-side container&#x2019;s life cycle and vice versa.\nLet&#x2019;s show how the containers will behave during their life cycle.\n0) Copy everything you need into the Deployment Server directory\n1) Remove existing container (Nginx or Tomcat)\n2) Run new one from the Docker images collection of the external Deployment Server.\n3) Add the artifact /dist to the &quot;deployable&quot; folder of the Docker container (/usr/share/nginx/html/)\nNow, let&#x2019;s see how it&#x2019;s being executed in the command line (simplified due to documentation purposes). The next block of code represents what is inside of the last stage of the Pipeline.\nsshagent (credentials: [&apos;my_ssh_token&apos;]) {\nsh &quot;&quot;&quot;\n// Copy artifact from workspace to deployment server\n// Manage container:\ndocker rm -f [mts-container]\ndocker run -itd --name=[mts-container] [base_image]\ndocker exec [mts-container] bash -C \\\\&quot;rm [container_deployment_folder]/*\\\\&quot;\ndocker cp [artifact] [mts-container]:[container_deployment_folder]\n&quot;&quot;&quot;\n}\nFor every operation performed in the external Deployment Server, it is necessary to define where those commands are going to be executed. So, for each one of previous docker commands, this should appear before:\nssh -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no root@10.40.235.244\nDocker Compose\nThe second way of deployment will be by orchestrating both elements of the application: The Angular client-side and the Java server-side. Both elements will be running in Docker containers as well, but in this case they won&#x2019;t be independent anymore. Docker Compose will be in charge of keeping both containers up, or to put them down.\nProject adjustment\nIn order to perform this second way of deployment, some files will be created in the project. The first one is the Dockerfile for the Angular client-side. This file will pull (if necessary) an nginx Docker image and copy the Angular artifact (/dist folder) inside of the deployment folder of the image. It will be located in the main directory of the Angular client-side project.\nThe second file is the Dockerfile for the Java server-side. Its function will be quite similar to the Angular one. It will run a tomcat Docker image and copy the Java artifact (mythaistar.war file) in its deployment folder.\nFinally, as long as the docker-compose is being used, a file containing its configuration will be necessary as well. A new folder one the main My That Star&#x2019;s directory is created, and it&#x2019;s called /docker. Inside there is just a docker-compose.yml file. It contains all the information needed to orchestrate the deployment process. For example, which port both containers are going to be published on, and so on. This way of deployment will allow the application to be published or not just with one action.\ndocker-compose rm -f # down\ndocker-compose up --build -d # up fresh containers\nLet&#x2019;s have a look at the file itself:\nversion: &apos;3&apos;\nservices:\nclient_compose:\nbuild: &quot;angular&quot;\nports:\n- &quot;8091:80&quot;\ndepends_on:\n- server_compose\nserver_compose:\nbuild: &quot;java&quot;\nports:\n- &quot;9091:8080&quot;\nThis Orchestrated Deployment will offer some interesting possibilities for the future of the application.\n"},{"id":1027,"path":"../..\\..\\..\\..\\..\\xampp\\htdocs\\devonfw.github.io\\website\\pages\\docs/master-my-thai-star.asciidoc_cicd.html#future-deployment.asciidoc","type":"docs","title":"Future Deployment","body":"90.2.6. Future Deployment\nThe My Thai Star project is going to be built in many technologies. Thus, let&#x2019;s think about one deployment schema that allow the Angular client to communicate to all three back ends: Java, Node and .NET.\nAs long as Docker containers are being used, it shouldn&#x2019;t be that hard to deal with this &quot;distributed&quot; deployment. The schema represents 6 Docker containers that will have client-side(s) and server-side(s). Each of 3 Angular client containers (those in red) are going to communicate with different back-ends. So, when the deployment is finished, it would be possible to use all three server-sides just by changing the &quot;port&quot; in the URL.\nLet&#x2019;s see how it would look like:\nReverse proxy strategy using Traefik\nThis implementation is the same as described at My Thai Star deployment wiki page. The only thing that changes is that Traefik is used instead of NGINX.\nUsing Traefik as reverse proxy, we can define the routes using labels in the docker containers instead of using a nginx.conf file. With this, it is not necessary to modify the reverse proxy container for each application. In addition, as Traefik is listening to the docker daemon, it can detect new containers and create routes for them without rebooting.\nExample of labels:\nlabels:\n- &quot;traefik.http.routers.angular.rule=PathPrefix(`/`)&quot;\n- &quot;traefik.http.services.angular.loadBalancer.healthcheck.path=/health&quot;\n- &quot;traefik.http.services.angular.loadBalancer.healthcheck.interval=10s&quot;\n- &quot;traefik.http.services.angular.loadBalancer.healthcheck.scheme=http&quot;\nHow to use it\nIf you want to build the images from code, change to My Thai Star root folder and execute:\n$ docker-compose -f docker-compose.traefik.yml up -d --build\nIf you want to build the images from artifacts, change to traefik folder (reverse-proxy/traefik) and execute:\n$ docker-compose up -d --build\nAfter a seconds, when the healthcheck detects that containers are running, your application will be available at http://localhost:8090. Also, the Traefik dashboard is available at http://localhost:8080.\nIf you want to check the behaviour of the application when you scale up the backend, you can execute:\n$ docker-compose scale java=5\nWith this, the access to the java backend will be using the load balacing method: Weighted Round Robin.\n"},{"id":1028,"path":"../..\\..\\..\\..\\..\\xampp\\htdocs\\devonfw.github.io\\website\\pages\\docs/master-my-thai-star.asciidoc_cicd.html#nkaas.asciidoc","type":"docs","title":"MyThaiStar on Native Kubernetes as a Service (nKaaS)","body":"90.3.

Two-Factor Authentication\nTwo-factor Authentication (2FA) provides an additional level of security to your account. Once enabled, in addition to supplying your username and password to login, you&#x2019;ll be prompted for a code generated by your Google authenticator. For example, a password manager on one of your devices.\nBy enabling 2FA, to log into your account an additional one-time password is required what requires access to your paired device. This massively increases the barrier for an attacker to break into your account.\nBackend mechanism\nIn the backend, we utilize Spring Security for any authentication.\nFollowing the arrows, one can see all processes regarding authentication. The main idea is to check all credentials depending on their 2FA status and then either grand access to the specific user or deny access. This picture illustrates a normal authentication with username and password.\nWhen dealing with 2FA, another provider and filter is handling the request from /verify\nHere you can observe which filter will be used.\nJWTAuthenticationFilter does intercept any request, which enforces being authenticated via JWT\nNote\nWhenever the secret or qr code gets transferred between two parties, one must enforce SSL/TLS or IPsec to be comply with RFC 6238.\nActivating Two-Factor Authentication\nIn the current state, TOTP\nwill be used for OTP generation.

Java design\nIntroduction\nThe Java backend for My Thai Star application is going to be based on:\nDEVON4J as the Java framework\nDevonfw as the Development environment\nCobigen as code generation tool\nTo know more details about the above technologies please visit the following documentation:\nDEVON4J\nDevonfw\nCobigen\nBasic architecture details\nFollowing the DEVON4J conventions the Java My Thai Star backend is going to be developed dividing the application in Components and using a three layers architecture.\nProject modules\nUsing the DEVON4J approach for the Java backend project we will have a structure of a Maven project formed by three projects\napi: Stores all the REST interfaces and corresponding Request/Response objects.\ncore: Stores all the logic and functionality of the application.\nserver: Configures the packaging of the application.\nWe can automatically generate this project structure using the DEVON4J Maven archetype\nComponents\nThe application is going to be divided in different components to encapsulate the different domains of the application functionalities.\nAs main components we will find:\nBookingmanagement: Manages the bookings part of the application. With this component the users (anonymous/logged in) can create new bookings or cancel an existing booking. The users with waiter role can see all scheduled bookings.\nOrdermanagement: This component handles the process to order dishes (related to bookings). A user (as a host or as a guest) can create orders (that contain dishes) or cancel an existing one. The users with waiter role can see all ordered orders.\nDishmanagement: This component groups the logic related to the menu (dishes) view. Its main feature is to provide the client with the data of the available dishes but also can be used by other components (Ordermanagement) as a data provider in some processes.\nUsermanagement: Takes care of the User Profile management, allowing to create and update the data profiles.\nAs common components (that don&#x2019;t exactly represent an application&#x2019;s area but provide functionalities that can be used by the main components):\nImagemanagement: Manages the images of the application. In a first approach the Dishmanagement component and the Usermanagement component will have an image as part of its data. The Imagemanagement component will expose the functionality to store and retrieve this kind of data.\nMailservice: with this service we will provide the functionality for sending email notifications. This is a shared service between different app components such as bookingmanagement or ordercomponent.\nOther components:\nSecurity (will manage the access to the private part of the application using a jwt implementation).\nTwitter integration: planned as a Microservice will provide the twitter integration needed for some specific functionalities of the application.\nLayers\nService Layer: this layer will expose the REST api to exchange information with the client applications.\nLogic Layer: the layer in charge of hosting the business logic of the application.\nData Access Layer: the layer to communicate with the data base.\nThis architecture is going to be reflected dividing each component of the application in different packages to match those three layers.\nComponent structure\nEach one of the components defined previously are going to be structured using the three-layers architecture. In each case we will have a service package, a logic package and a dataaccess package to fit the layers definition.\nDependency injection\nAs it is explained in the devonfw documentation we are going to implement the dependency injection pattern basing our solution on Spring and the Java standards: java.inject (JSR330) combined with JSR250.\nSeparation of API and implementation: Inside each layer we will separate the elements in different packages: api and impl. The api will store the interface with the methods definition and inside the impl we will store the class that implements the interface.\nUsage of JSR330: The Java standard set of annotations for dependency injection (@Named, @Inject, @PostConstruct, @PreDestroy, etc.) provides us with all the needed annotations to define our beans and inject them.\n@Named\npublic class MyBeanImpl implements MyBean {\n@Inject\nprivate MyOtherBean myOtherBean;\n@PostConstruct\npublic void init() {\n// initialization if required (otherwise omit this method)\n}\n@PreDestroy\npublic void dispose() {\n// shutdown bean, free resources if required (otherwise omit this method)\n}\n}\nLayers communication\nThe connection between layers, to access to the functionalities of each one, will be solved using the dependency injection and the JSR330 annotations.\nConnection Service - Logic\n@Named(&quot;DishmanagementRestService&quot;)\npublic class DishmanagementRestServiceImpl implements DishmanagementRestService {\n@Inject\nprivate Dishmanagement dishmanagement;\n// use the &apos;this.dishmanagement&apos; object to access to the functionalities of the logic layer of the component\n...\n}\nConnection Logic - Data Access\n@Named\npublic class DishmanagementImpl extends AbstractComponentFacade implements Dishmanagement {\n@Inject\nprivate DishDao dishDao;\n// use the &apos;this.dishDao&apos; to access to the functionalities of the data access layer of the component\n...\n}\nService layer\nThe services layer will be solved using REST services with the JAX-RS implementation.\nTo give service to the defined User Stories we will need to implement the following services:\nprovide all available dishes.\nsave a booking.\nsave an order.\nprovide a list of bookings (only for waiters) and allow filtering.\nprovide a list of orders (only for waiters) and allow filtering.\nlogin service (see the Security section).\nprovide the current user data (see the Security section)\nFollowing the naming conventions proposed for Devon4j applications we will define the following end points for the listed services.\n(POST) /mythaistar/services/rest/dishmanagement/v1/dish/search.\n(POST) /mythaistar/services/rest/bookingmanagement/v1/booking.\n(POST) /mythaistar/services/rest/ordermanagement/v1/order.\n(POST) /mythaistar/services/rest/bookingmanagement/v1/booking/search.\n(POST) /mythaistar/services/rest/ordermanagement/v1/order/search.\n(POST) /mythaistar/services/rest/ordermanagement/v1/order/filter (to filter with fields that does not belong to the Order entity).\n(POST) /mythaistar/login.\n(GET) /mythaistar/services/rest/security/v1/currentuser/.\nYou can find all the details for the services implementation in the Swagger definition included in the My Thai Star project on Github.\nService api\nThe api.rest package in the service layer of a component will store the definition of the service by a Java interface. In this definition of the service we will set-up the endpoints of the service, the type of data expected and returned, the HTTP method for each endpoint of the service and other configurations if needed.\n@Path(&quot;/dishmanagement/v1&quot;)\n@Consumes(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON)\n@Produces(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON)\npublic interface DishmanagementRestService {\n@GET\n@Path(&quot;/dish/{id}/&quot;)\npublic DishCto getDish(@PathParam(&quot;id&quot;) long id);\n...\n}\nService impl\nOnce the service api is defined we need to implement it using the Java interface as reference. We will add the service implementation class to the impl.rest package and implement the RestService interface.\n@Named(&quot;DishmanagementRestService&quot;)\npublic class DishmanagementRestServiceImpl implements DishmanagementRestService {\n@Inject\nprivate Dishmanagement dishmanagement;\n@Override\npublic DishCto getDish(long id) {\nreturn this.dishmanagement.findDish(id);\n}\n...\n}\nNote\nYou can see the Devon4j conventions for REST services here. And the My Thai Star services definition here as part of the My Thai Star project.\nLogic layer\nIn the logic layer we will locate all the business logic of the application. We will keep the same schema as we have done for the service layer, having an api package with the definition of the methods and a impl package for the implementation.\nAlso, inside the api package, a to package will be the place to store the transfer objects needed to pass data through the layers of the component.\nThe logic api definition:\npublic interface Dishmanagement {\nDishCto findDish(Long id);\n...\n}\nThe logic impl class:\n@Named\npublic class DishmanagementImpl extends AbstractComponentFacade implements Dishmanagement {\n@Inject\nprivate DishDao dishDao;\n@Override\npublic DishCto findDish(Long id) {\nreturn getBeanMapper().map(this.dishDao.findOne(id), DishCto.class);\n}\n...\n}\nThe BeanMapper will provide the needed transformations between entity and transfer objects.\nAlso, the logic layer is the place to add validation for Authorization based on roles as we will see later.\nData Access layer\nThe data-access layer is responsible for managing the connections to access and process data. The mapping between java objects to a relational database is done in Devon4j with the spring-data-jpa.\nAs in the previous layers, the data-access layer will have both api and impl packages. However, in this case, the implementation will be slightly different. The api package will store the component main entities and, inside the _api package, another api.repo package will store the Repositories. The repository interface will extend DefaultRepository interface (located in com.devonfw.module.jpa.dataaccess.api.data package of devon4j-starter-spring-data-jpa ).\nFor queries we will differentiate between static queries (that will be located in a mapped file) and dynamic queries (implemented with QueryDsl). You can find all the details about how to manage queries with Devon4j here.\nThe default data base included in the project will be the H2 instance included with the Devon4j projects.\nTo get more details about pagination, data base security, _concurrency control, inheritance or how to solve the different relationships between entities visit the official devon4j dataaccess documentation.\nSecurity with Json Web Token\nFor the Authentication and Authorization the app will implement the json web token protocol.\nJwt basics\nA user will provide a username / password combination to our auth server.\nThe auth server will try to identify the user and, if the credentials match, will issue a token.\nThe user will send the token as the Authorization header to access resources on server protected by JWT Authentication.\nJwt implementation details\nThe Json Web Token pattern will be implemented based on the Spring Security framework that is provided by default in the Devon4j projects.\nAuthentication\nBased on the Spring Security approach, we will implement a class extending WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter (Devon4j already provides the BaseWebSecurityConfig class) to define the security entry point and filters. Also, as My Thai Star is a mainly public application, we will define here the resources that won&#x2019;t be secured.\nList of unsecured resources:\n/services/rest/dishmanagement/**: to allow anonymous users to see the dishes info in the menu section.\n/services/rest/ordermanagement/v1/order: to allow anonymous users to save an order. They will need a booking token but they won&#x2019;t be authenticated to do this task.\n/services/rest/bookingmanagement/v1/booking: to allow anonymous users to create a booking. Only a booking token is necessary to accomplish this task.\n/services/rest/bookingmanagement/v1/booking/cancel/**: to allow cancelling a booking from an email. Only the booking token is needed.\n/services/rest/bookingmanagement/v1/invitedguest/accept/**: to allow guests to accept an invite. Only a guest token is needed.\n/services/rest/bookingmanagement/v1/invitedguest/decline/**: to allow guests to reject an invite. Only a guest token is needed.\nTo configure the login we will set up the HttpSecurity object in the configure method of the class. We will define a JWTLoginFilter class that will handle the requests to the /login endpoint.\nhttp.[...].antMatchers(HttpMethod.POST, &quot;/login&quot;).permitAll().[...].addFilterBefore(new JWTLoginFilter(&quot;/login&quot;, authenticationManager()), UsernamePasswordAuthenticationFilter.class);\nIn the same HttpSecurity object we will set up the filter for the rest of the requests, to check the presence of the JWT token in the header. First we will need to create a JWTAuthenticationFilter class extending the GenericFilterBean class. Then we can add the filter to the HttpSecurity object\nhttp.[...].addFilterBefore(new JWTAuthenticationFilter(), UsernamePasswordAuthenticationFilter.class);\nFinally, as default users to start using the My Thai Star app we are going to define two profiles using the inMemoryAuthentication of the Spring Security framework. In the configure(AuthenticationManagerBuilder auth) method we will create:\nuser: waiter\npassword: waiter\nrole: Waiter\nuser: user0\npassword: password\nrole: Customer\nauth.inMemoryAuthentication().withUser(&quot;waiter&quot;).password(&quot;waiter&quot;).roles(&quot;Waiter&quot;).and().withUser(&quot;user0&quot;).password(&quot;password&quot;).roles(&quot;Customer&quot;);\nToken set up\nFollowing the official documentation the implementation details for the MyThaiStar&#x2019;s jwt will be:\nSecret: Used as part of the signature of the token, acting as a private key. For the showcase purposes we will use simply &quot;ThisIsASecret&quot;.\nToken Prefix schema: Bearer. The token will look like Bearer &lt;token&gt;\nHeader: Authorization. The response header where the token will be included. Also, in the requests, when checking the token it will be expected to be in the same header.\nThe Authorization header should be part of the Access-Control-Expose-Headers header to allow clients access to the Authorization header content (the token);\nThe claims are the content of the payload of the token. The claims are statements about the user, so we will include the user info in this section.\nsubject: &quot;sub&quot;. The username.\nissuer: &quot;iss&quot;. Who creates the token. We could use the url of our service but, as this is a showcase app, we simply will use &quot;MyThaiStarApp&quot;\nexpiration date: &quot;exp&quot;. Defines when the token expires.\ncreation date: &quot;iat&quot;. Defines when the token has been created.\nscope: &quot;scope&quot;. Array of strings to store the user roles.\nSignature Algorithm: To encrypt the token we will use the default algorithm HS512.\nAn example of a token claims before encryption would be:\n{sub=waiter, scope=[ROLE_Waiter], iss=MyThaiStarApp, exp=1496920280, iat=1496916680}\nCurrent User request\nTo provide to the client with the current user data our application should expose a service to return the user details. In Devon4j applications the /general/service/impl/rest/SecurityRestServiceImpl.java class is ready to do that.\n@Path(&quot;/security/v1&quot;)\n@Named(&quot;SecurityRestService&quot;)\npublic class SecurityRestServiceImpl {\n@Produces(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON)\n@GET\n@Path(&quot;/currentuser/&quot;)\npublic UserDetailsClientTo getCurrentUserDetails(@Context HttpServletRequest request) {\n}\n}\nwe only will need to implement the getCurrentUserDetails method.\nAuthorization\nWe need to secure three services, that only should be accessible for users with role Waiter:\n(POST) /mythaistar/services/rest/bookingmanagement/v1/booking/search.\n(POST) /mythaistar/services/rest/ordermanagement/v1/order/search.\n(POST) /mythaistar/services/rest/ordermanagement/v1/order/filter.\nAs part of the token we are providing the user Role. So, when validating the token, we can obtain that same information and build a UsernamePasswordAuthenticationToken with username and the roles as collection of Granted Authorities.\nDoing so, afterwards, in the implementation class of the logic layer we can set up the related methods with the java security &apos;@RolesAllowed&apos; annotation to block the access to the resource to users that does not match the expected roles.\n@RolesAllowed(Roles.WAITER)\npublic PaginatedListTo&lt;BookingEto&gt; findBookings(BookingSearchCriteriaTo criteria) {\nreturn findBookings(criteria);\n}\n"},{"id":1041,"path":"../..\\..\\..\\..\\..\\xampp\\htdocs\\devonfw.github.io\\website\\pages\\docs/master-my-thai-star.asciidoc_technical-design.html#net-design.asciidoc","type":"docs","title":".NET design","body":"86.2.2. .NET design\nTODO\n"},{"id":1042,"path":"../..\\..\\..\\..\\..\\xampp\\htdocs\\devonfw.github.io\\website\\pages\\docs/master-my-thai-star.asciidoc_technical-design.html#nodejs-design.asciidoc","type":"docs","title":"Node.js design (deprecated)","body":"86.2.3.

We will define the following end points for the listed services.\n(POST) /mythaistar/services/rest/dishmanagement/v1/dish/search.\n(POST) /mythaistar/services/rest/bookingmanagement/v1/booking.\n(POST) /mythaistar/services/rest/ordermanagement/v1/order.\n(POST) /mythaistar/services/rest/bookingmanagement/v1/booking/search.\n(POST) /mythaistar/services/rest/ordermanagement/v1/order/search.\n(POST) /mythaistar/services/rest/ordermanagement/v1/order/filter (to filter with fields that does not belong to the Order entity).\n(POST) /mythaistar/login.\n(GET) /mythaistar/services/rest/security/v1/currentuser/.\nYou can find all the details for the services implementation in the Swagger definition included in the My Thai Star project on Github.\nTo treat these services separately, the following routers were created:\nbookingmanagement: will answer all requests with the prefix /mythaistar/services/rest/bookingmanagement/v1\ndishmanagement: will answer all requests with the prefix /mythaistar/services/rest/dishmanagement/v1\nordermanagement: will answer all requests with the prefix /mythaistar/services/rest/ordermanagement/v1\nThese routers will define the behavior for each service and use the logical layer.\nAn example of service definition:\nrouter.post(&apos;/booking/search&apos;, (req: types.CustomRequest, res: Response) =&gt; {\ntry {\n// body content must be SearchCriteria\nif (!types.isSearchCriteria(req.body)) {\nthrow {code: 400, message: &apos;No booking token given&apos; };\n}\n// use the searchBooking method defined at business logic\nbusiness.searchBooking(req.body, (err: types.Error | null, bookingEntity: types.PaginatedList) =&gt; {\nif (err) {\nres.status(err.code || 500).json(err.message);\n} else {\nres.json(bookingEntity);\n}\n});\n} catch (err) {\nres.status(err.code || 500).json({ message: err.message });\n}\n});\nLogic layer and Data access layer\nIn the logic layer we will locate all the business logic of the application. It will be located in the file logic.ts. If in this layer we need to get access to the data, we make use of data access layer directly, in this case using OASP4fn with the DynamoDB adapter.\nExample:\nexport async function cancelOrder(orderId: string, callback: (err: types.Error | null) =&gt; void) {\nlet order: dbtypes.Order;\ntry {\n// Data access\norder = await oasp4fn.table(&apos;Order&apos;, orderId).promise() as dbtypes.Order;\n[...]\n}\nWe could define the data access layer separately, but oasp4fn allows us to do this in a simple and clear way. So, we decided to not separate the access layer to the logic business.\nSecurity with Json Web Token\nFor the Authentication and Authorization the app will implement the json web token protocol.\nJwt basics\nRefer to Jwt basiscs for more information.\nJwt implementation details\nThe Json Web Token pattern will be implemented based on the JSON web token library available on npm.\nAuthentication\nBased on the JSON web token approach, we will implement a class Authentication to define the security entry point and filters. Also, as My Thai Star is a mainly public application, we will define here the resources that won&#x2019;t be secured.\nList of unsecured resources:\n/services/rest/dishmanagement/**: to allow anonymous users to see the dishes info in the menu section.\n/services/rest/ordermanagement/v1/order: to allow anonymous users to save an order.

Only a guest token is needed.\n/services/rest/bookingmanagement/v1/invitedguest/decline/**: to allow guests to reject an invite. Only a guest token is needed.\nTo configure the login we will create an instance of Authentication in the app file and then we will use the method auth for handle the requests to the /login endpoint.\napp.post(&apos;/mythaistar/login&apos;, auth.auth);\nTo verify the presence of the Authorization token in the headers, we will register in the express the Authentication.registerAuthentication middleware. This middleware will check if the token is correct, if so, it will place the user in the request and continue to process it. If the token is not correct it will continue processing the request normally.\napp.use(auth.registerAuthentication);\nFinally, we have two default users created in the database:\nuser: waiter\npassword: waiter\nrole: WAITER\nuser: user0\npassword: password\nrole: CUSTOMER\nToken set up\nFollowing the official documentation the implementation details for the MyThaiStar&#x2019;s jwt will be:\nSecret: Used as part of the signature of the token, acting as a private key. It can be modified at config.ts file.\nToken Prefix schema: Bearer. The token will look like Bearer &lt;token&gt;\nHeader: Authorization. The response header where the token will be included.

In this case the Authentication has a method called getCurrentUser which will return the user data. We only need register it at express.\napp.get(&apos;/mythaistar/services/rest/security/v1/currentuser&apos;, auth.getCurrentUser);\nAuthorization\nWe need to secure three services, that only should be accessible for users with role Waiter:\n(POST) /mythaistar/services/rest/bookingmanagement/v1/booking/search.\n(POST) /mythaistar/services/rest/ordermanagement/v1/order/search.\n(POST) /mythaistar/services/rest/ordermanagement/v1/order/filter.\nTo ensure this, the Authorization class has the securizedEndpoint method that guarantees access based on the role. This method can be used as middleware in secure services. As the role is included in the token, once validated we will have this information in the request and the middleware can guarantee access or return a 403 error.\napp.use(&apos;/mythaistar/services/rest/ordermanagement/v1/order/filter&apos;, auth.securizedEndpoint(&apos;WAITER&apos;));\napp.use(&apos;/mythaistar/services/rest/ordermanagement/v1/order/search&apos;, auth.securizedEndpoint(&apos;WAITER&apos;));\napp.use(&apos;/mythaistar/services/rest/bookingmanagement/v1/booking/search&apos;, auth.securizedEndpoint(&apos;WAITER&apos;));\n"},{"id":1043,"path":"../..\\..\\..\\..\\..\\xampp\\htdocs\\devonfw.github.io\\website\\pages\\docs/master-my-thai-star.asciidoc_technical-design.html#serverless-design.asciidoc","type":"docs","title":"Serverless design (deprecated)","body":"86.2.4.

Then the app folder has been organized as Angular recommends and goes as follows:\napp\ncomponents\nsub-components\nshared\ncomponent files\nmain app component\nassets folder\nenvironments folder\nrest of angular files\nThis structure can be shown in the following example image:\nMain Views and components\nList of components that serve as a main view to navigate or components developed to make atomically a group of functionalities which given their nature, can be highly reusable through the app.\nNote: no-name-route corresponds to whatever URL the user introduced and does not exist, it redirects to HomeComponent.\nPublic area\nAppComponent\nContains the components that are on top of all views, including:\nOrder sidenav\nSidenav where selected orders are displayed with their total price and some comments.\nNavigation sidenav (only for mobile)\nThis sidenav proposal is to let user navigate through the app when the screen is too small to show the navigation buttons on the header.\nHeader\nIt contains the title, and some other basic functions regarding open and close sidenavs.\nFooter (only for desktop)\nAt the end of the page that shows only when open on desktop.\nHomeComponent\nMain view that shows up when the app initializes.\nMenuComponent\nView where the users can view, filter and select the dishes (with their extras) they want to order it contains a component to each menu entry:\nMenu-card\nThis component composes all the data of a dish in a card. Component made to display indeterminate number of dishes easily.\nBookTableComponent\nView to make book a table in a given data with a given number of assistants or create a reservation with a number of invitations via email.\nBook-table-dialog\nDialog which opens as a result of fulfilling the booking form, it displays all the data of the booking attempt, if everything is correct, the user can send the information or cancel if something is wrong.\nInvitation-dialog\nDialog which opens as a result of fulfilling the invitation form, it displays all the data of the booking with friends attempt, if everything is correct, the user can send the information or cancel if something is wrong.\nUserArea\nGroup of dialogs with the proposal of giving some functionalities to the user, as login, register, change password or connect with Twitter.\nLogin-dialog\nDialog with a tab to navigate between login and register.\nPassword-dialog\nFunctionality reserved to already logged users, in this dialog the user can change freely their password.\nTwitter-dialog\nDialog designed specifically to connect your user account with Twitter.\nWaiter cockpit area\nRestricted area to workers of the restaurant, here we can see all information about booked tables with the selected orders and the reservations with all the guests and their acceptance or decline of the event.\nOrderCockpitComponent\nData table with all the booked tables and a filter to search them, to show more info about that table you can click on it and open a dialog.\nOrder-dialog\nComplete display of data regarding the selected table and its orders.\nReservationCockpitComponent\nData table with all the reservations and a filter to search them, to show more info about that table you can click on it and open a dialog.\nReservation-dialog\nComplete display of data regarding the selected table and its guests.\nEmail Management\nAs the application send emails to both guests and hosts, we choose an approach based on URL&#x2019;s where the email contain a button with an URL to a service in the app and a token, front-end read that token and depending on the URL, will redirect to one service or another. For example:\nhttp://localhost:4200/booking/cancel/CB_20170605_8fb5bc4c84a1c5049da1f6beb1968afc\nThis URL will tell the app that is a cancellation of a booking with the token CB_20170605_8fb5bc4c84a1c5049da1f6beb1968afc. The app will process this information, send it to back-end with the correct headers, show the confirmation of the event and redirect to home page.\nThe main cases at the moment are:\nAccept Invite\nA guest accept an invitation sent by a host. It will receive another email to decline if it change its mind later on.\nReject Invite\nA guest decline the invitation.\nCancel Reservation\nA host cancel the reservation, everybody that has accepted or not already answered will receive an email notifying this event is canceled. Also all the orders related to this reservations will be removed.\nCancel Orders\nWhen you have a reservation, you will be assigned to a token, with that token you can save your order in the restaurant. When sent, you will receive an email confirming the order and the possibility to remove it.\nServices and directives\nServices are where all the main logic between components of that view should be. This includes calling a remote server, composing objects, calculate prices, etc.\nDirectives are a single functionality that are related to a component.\nAs it can be seen in the basic structure, every view that has a minimum of logic or need to call a server has its own service located in the shared folder.\nAlso, services and directives can be created to compose a reusable piece of code that will be reused in some parts of the code:\nPrice-calculator-service\nThis service located in the shared folder of sidenav contains the basic logic to calculate the price of a single order (with all the possibilities) and to calculate the price of a full list of orders for a table. As this is used in the sidenav and in the waiter cockpit, it has been exported as a service to be imported where needed and easily testable.\nAuthentication\nAuthentication services serves as a validator of roles and login and, at the same time, stores the basic data regarding security and authentication.\nMain task of this services is to provide visibility at app level of the current user information:\nCheck if the user is logged or not.\nCheck the permissions of the current user.\nStore the username and the JWT token.\nSnackService\nService created to serve as a factory of Angular Material Snackbars, which are used commonly through the app. This service accepts some parameters to customize the snackBar and opens it with this parameters.\nWindowService\nFor responsiveness reasons, the dialogs have to accept a width parameter to adjust to screen width and this information is given by Window object, as it is a good practice to have it in an isolated service, which also calculates the width percentage to apply on the dialogs.\nEqual-validator-directive\nThis directive located in the shared folder of userArea is used in 2 fields to make sure they have the same value. This directive is used in confirm password fields in register and change password.\nMock Backend\nTo develop meanwhile a real back-end is being developed let us to make a more realistic application and to make easier the adaptation when the backend is able to be connected and called. Its structure is as following:\nContains the three main groups of functionalities in the application. Every group is composed by:\nAn interface with all the methods to implement.\nA service that implements that interface, the main task of this service is to choose between real backend and mock backend depending on an environment variable.\nMock backend service which implements all the methods declared in the interface using mock data stored in a local file and mainly uses Lodash to operate the arrays.\nReal backend service works as Mock backend but in this case the methods call for server rest services through http.\nBooking\nThe booking group of functionalities manages the calls to reserve a table with a given time and assistants or with guests, get reservations filtered, accept or decline invitations or cancel the reservation.\nOrders\nManagement of the orders, including saving, filtering and cancel an order.\nDishes\nThe dishes group of functionalities manages the calls to get and filter dishes.\nLogin\nLogin manages the userArea logic: login, register and change password.\nSecurity\nMy Thai Star security is composed by two main security services:\nAuth-guard\nFront-end security approach, this service implements an interface called CanActivate that comes from angular/router module. CanActivate interface forces you to implement a canActivate() function which returns a Boolean.\nThis service checks with the AuthService stored data if the user is logged and if he has enough permission to access the waiter cockpit. This prevents that a forbidden user could access to waiter cockpit just by editing the URL in the browser.\nJWT\nJSON Web Token consists of a token that is generated by the server when the user logs in. Once provided, the token has to be included in an Authentication header on every Http call to the rest service, otherwise the call will be forbidden.\nJWT also has an expiration date and a role checking, so if a user has not enough permissions or keeps logged for a long certain amount of time that exceeds this expiration date, the next time he calls for a service call, the server will return an error and forbid the call. You can log again to restore the token.\nHttpClient\nTo implement this Authorization header management, an HttpClient service has been implemented.\nThis services works as an envelope of Http, providing some more functionalities, likes a header management and an automatically management of a server token error in case the JWT has expired, corrupted or not permitted.\n"},{"id":1047,"path":"../..\\..\\..\\..\\..\\xampp\\htdocs\\devonfw.github.io\\website\\pages\\docs/master-my-thai-star.asciidoc_technical-design.html#xamarin-design.asciidoc","type":"docs","title":"Xamarin design","body":"86.3.2.

Java testing\nComponent testing\nWe are going to test our components as a unit using Spring Test and Devon4j-test modules.\nIn order to test a basic component of the app first we will create a test class in the src/test/java folder and inside the main package of the test module. We will name the class following the convention.\n[Component]Test\nThen, in the declaration of the test class, we will use the @SpringBootTest annotation to run the application context. In addition, we will extend the ComponentTest from Devon4j-test module to have access to the main functionalities of the module, see more details here.\nSpring Test allows us to use Dependency Injection so we can inject our component directly using the @Inject annotation.\nEach test will be represented by a method annotated with @Test. Inside the method we will test one functionality, evaluating the result thanks to the asserts provided by the ComponentTest class that we are extending.\nA simple test example\n@SpringBootTest(classes = SpringBootApp.class)\npublic class DishmanagementTest extends ComponentTest {\n@Inject\nprivate Dishmanagement dishmanagement;\n@Test\npublic void findAllDishes() {\nPaginatedListTo&lt;DishCto&gt; result = this.dishmanagement.findDishes();\nassertThat(result).isNotNull();\n}\n...\n}\nRunning the tests\nFrom Eclipse\nWe can run the test from within Eclipse with the contextual menu Run As &gt; JUnit Test.

Angular testing\nMyThaiStar testing is made using Angular default testing environment and syntax language: Karma and Jasmine\nTo test an element of the application, you indicate that tests are a special type of files with the extension .spec.ts, then, in MyThaiStar angular/CLI config you can notice that there is an array with only one entry, Karma, with at the same time has one entry to Karma.config.js.\nIn the configuration of Karma we indicate which syntax language we are going to use (currently Jasmine as said before) between some other configurations, it is remarkable the last one: browsers. By default, the only available browser is chrome, that is because Karma works opening a chrome view to run all the tests, in that same window, Karma shows the result or errors of the test run. But we can add some other browser to adjust to our necessities, for example, in some automatic processes that run from console, it is not an option to open a chrome window, in that case, MyThaiStar used PhantomJS and ChromeHeadless.\nTaking all of this into account, to run the test in MyThaiStar we need to move to project root folder and run this command : ng test --browser &lt;browser&gt;\nNote\nIf you run just ng test it will run the three browser options simultaneously, giving as a result three test runs and outputs, it can cause timeouts and unwanted behaviors, if you want a shortcut to run the test with chrome window you can just run yarn test so we really encourage to not use just ng test.\nHere we are going to see how Client side testing of MyThaiStar has been done.\nTesting Components\nAngular components were created using angular/CLI ng create component so they already come with an spec file to test them. The only thing left to do is to add the providers and imports needed in the component to work as the component itself, once this is done, the most basic test is to be sure that all the dependencies and the component itself can be correctly created.\nAs an example, this is the spec.ts of the menu view component:\nall the imports...\ndescribe(&apos;MenuComponent&apos;, () =&gt; {\nlet component: MenuComponent;\nlet fixture: ComponentFixture&lt;MenuComponent&gt;;\nbeforeEach(async(() =&gt; {\nTestBed.configureTestingModule({\ndeclarations: [ MenuComponent, MenuCardComponent ],\nproviders: [SidenavService, MenuService, SnackBarService],\nimports: [\nBrowserAnimationsModule,\nBackendModule.forRoot({environmentType: 0, restServiceRoot: &apos;v1&apos;}),\nCovalentModule,\n],\n})\n.compileComponents();\n}));\nbeforeEach(() =&gt; {\nfixture = TestBed.createComponent(MenuComponent);\ncomponent = fixture.componentInstance;\nfixture.detectChanges();\n});\nit(&apos;should create&apos;, () =&gt; {\nexpect(component).toBeTruthy();\n});\n});\nFirst we declare the component to be tested and a Fixture object, then, we configure the testingModule right in the same way we could configure the MenuModule with the difference here that tests always have to use the mockBackend because we do not want to really depend on a server to test our components.\nOnce configured the test module, we have to prepare the context of the test, in this case we create the component, that is exactly what is going on in the beforeEach() function.\nFinally, we are ready to use the component and it&#x2019;s fixture to check if the component has bee correctly created.\nAt this moment this is the case for most of the components, in the future, some work would be applied on this matter to have a full testing experience in MyThaiStar components.\nDialog components\nDialog components are in a special category because they can not be tested normally. In the way Material implements the opening of dialogs, you have to create a component that will load into a dialog, to tell the module to load this components when needed, they have to be added into a special array category: EntryComponents. So, to test them, we need to import them in the test file as well.\nAlso, the testing code to open the component is a bit different too:\n...\nbeforeEach(() =&gt; {\ndialog = TestBed.get(MdDialog);\ncomponent = dialog.open(CommentDialogComponent).componentInstance;\n});\n...\nThat is right, the beforeEach() function is slightly different from the the example above, in this case we have to force to the test to know that the component is only displayed in a dialog, so we have to open a dialog with this component in order to access it.\nTesting Services\nAs well as components, services can be tested too, actually, they are even more necessary to be tested because they have inside more complex logic and data management.\nAs an example of testing services i am going to use a well done services, with a specific purpose and with its logic completely tested, the price-calculator service:\n...\ndescribe(&apos;PriceCalculatorService&apos;, () =&gt; {\nbeforeEach(() =&gt; {\nTestBed.configureTestingModule({\nproviders: [PriceCalculatorService],\n});\n});\nit(&apos;should be properly injected&apos;, inject([PriceCalculatorService], (service: PriceCalculatorService) =&gt; {\nexpect(service).toBeTruthy();\n}));\ndescribe(&apos;check getPrice method&apos;, () =&gt; {\nit(&apos;should calculate price for single order without extras&apos;, inject([PriceCalculatorService], (service: PriceCalculatorService) =&gt; {\nconst order: OrderView = {\ndish: {\nid: 0,\nprice: 12.50,\nname: &apos;Order without extras&apos;,\n},\norderLine: {\ncomment: &apos;&apos;,\namount: 1,\n},\nextras: [],\n};\nexpect(service.getPrice(order)).toEqual(order.dish.price);\n}));\n...\nIn services test, we have to inject the service in order to use it, then we can define some initializing contexts to test if the functions of the services returns the expected values, in the example we can see how an imaginary order is created and expected the function getPrice() to correctly calculate the price of that order.\nIn this same test file you can find some more test regarding all the possibilities of use in that services: orders with and without extras, single order, multiple orders and so on.\nSome services as well as the components have only tested that they are correctly created and they dependencies properly injected, in the future, will be full covering regarding this services test coverage.\nTesting in a CI environment\n"},{"id":1056,"path":"../..\\..\\..\\..\\..\\xampp\\htdocs\\devonfw.github.io\\website\\pages\\docs/master-my-thai-star.asciidoc_testing.html#xamarin-testing.asciidoc","type":"docs","title":"Xamarin testing","body":"88.2.2.

This includes:\nCloning the official My-Thai-Star (https://github.com/devonfw/my-thai-star) repository into your GitLab, which allows you to do customizations on your own.\nAdding a build job for the Angular front-end, including a SonarQube analysis and a delivery to Nexus as zip and docker image.\nAdding a build job for the Java back-end, including a SonarQube analysis and a deployment to Nexus as zip and docker image.\nAdding a deployment job for the Angular front-end\nAdding a deployment job for the Java back-end\nAdding a deployment job for the reverse proxy. Please see My Thai Star deployment documentation\nEspecially the build and delpoyment jobs require several additional Jenkins plugins, which are not part of the PL by default. The Template will also take care of those installations.\nAll build and deployment jobs are taken from the official My-Thai-Star (https://github.com/devonfw/my-thai-star) repository. The created build and deployment jobs inside Jenkins will use the Jenkinsfiles from the cloned repo in Gitlab. These are currently the following Jenkinsfiles:\nJenkins Jobs\nTable 45.

Prerequisities before running the template\nProduction Line Components\nTo use the template you need to make sure that your PL has the following components installed:\nJenkins (required to run the template and to execute the build/deployment Jobs)\nSonarQube (required for a static code analysis)\nGitLab (required as a repostiory)\nNexus3 (required to store the build artifacts)\nTip\nAdditional components can be ordered from the ProductionLine service team.\nTechnical User Setup\nIn order to configure the services, we need technical users for the following components:\nGitlab\nNexus3\nSonarQube\nThe following sections describe how to configure the components to enable technical users and tokens.\nManual configuration\nIn order to configure the Production Line components manually you can follow this guide\nAutomatic configuration\nIn order to configure the Production Line components automatically you can follow this guide\nThere is one thing that initialize-template can not do automatically: the gitlab token creation.\nThe creation of the GitLab Group and Project will require a private GitLab token which has to be created manually. The token can be obtained like this:\nGo to your Profile in Gitlab\nNext click on the pen icon\nOn the left menu choose Access Tokens and put token name and check fields like below\nClick &quot;Create personal access token&quot;, you should receive notification about created token and token string. Copy the token string.\nImportant\nThe GitLab API user needs to have API access and the rights to create a new group. To set this permission follow the next steps:\nEnter the Admin control panel\nSelect &apos;Users&apos;\nSelect the user(s) in question and click &apos;Edit&apos;\nScroll down to &apos;Access&apos; and un-tick &apos;Can Create Group&apos;\nBuild/Deployment Requirements\nThe My Thai Star CICD pipelines will create a docker image and then the deployment pipelines will use it in order to deploy the application.

How to run it\nWarning\nIf Jenkins needs to install plugins, a restart will be performed.\nSo please make sure, that nothing important is running.\nImportant\nWe have job-parameters inside the template Jenkinsfile that will only be active if Jenkins has run the job at least once!\nSetup template job in Jenkins\nThe guide on how to add a template to your Jenkins can be found in the root directory of the template repository: https://github.com/devonfw/production-line.git\nExecute the Jenkins job in your Jenkins\nGo to the Jenkins job.\nExecute job.\nIt will try to configure and setup the PL components such as Jenkins/Gitlab and Nexus.\nImportant\nIf a restart was needed, you need to trigger the job again!\nThe job should now show the required parameters, you only need to change the GITLAB PRIVATE TOKEN that you should have generated in the prerequisite section\nWhen everything is &quot;green&quot; the template is done and you can have a look in the created &quot;MTS&quot; folder in Jenkins.\nImportant\nIt will take a few minutes to clone the official MTS repository to the internal Gitlab. So you need to wait before executing the build jobs at the frist time.\nBuild Jobs\nYou can now execute the build for the frontend and also the backend. They do not require any parameters to run. The expected result is, that both jobs can run without any errors. They will build, test and deploy the artifacts to Nexus3.\nDeployment Jobs\nAll deployment jobs have several parameters configured in their Jenkinsfile. Unfortunately, Jenkins does not pick them up immediatly, so you need to execute the job once, by pressing the &quot;Build now&quot; button.\nThe run should fail quite fast and once you refresh the page, the &quot;Build now&quot; button should have changed to &quot;Build with Parameters&quot;. If you now click on the button you should see the parameters below:\nYou need to set the following parameters in order to get it running:\nTable 46. Required Parameters\nParameter\nDescription\nregistryUrl\nThe docker registry URL where image is stored.\nregistryCredentialsId\nThe nexus credentials to access to the docker registry.\nVERSION\nThe version of the image that was built in the build jobs. For example &quot;1.12.3-SNAPSHOT&quot;.\ndockerNetwork\nThe docker network where the container will be deployed.\nAlso, the reverse proxy deployment has two more parameters:\nTable 47. Reverse Proxy extra parameters\nParameter\nDescription\nbuildReverseProxy\nIf true, it will build a new reverse proxy docker image and then deploy that image.\nport\nThe port where the application will be listening. It&#x2019;s a host port, not a container port.\nNote\nYou can deploy multiple versions of My Thai Star in the same machine by changing the docker network in all deployments and the port in the reverse proxy deployment.\nImportant\nYou must choose the same docker network for all deployments\nImportant\nYou need to deploy the angular and java applications before the reverse proxy. Also, the first you need to check the buildReverseProxy parameter in order to create the reverse proxy image and then deploy the container.\n&#x2190;&#xA0;Previous:&#xA0;MrChecker&#xA0;| &#x2191;&#xA0;Up:&#xA0;Production Line Templates&#xA0;| &#x2302;&#xA0;Home:&#xA0;devonfw guide&#xA0;| Next:&#xA0;Troubleshooting&#xA0;&#x2192;\n"},{"id":1102,"path":"../..\\..\\..\\..\\..\\xampp\\htdocs\\devonfw.github.io\\website\\pages\\docs/master-production-line.asciidoc_troubleshooting.html#master-production-line.asciidoc_troubleshooting","type":"docs","title":"Troubleshooting","body":"69.

This happens outside Solicitor.\nThe import step reads this data and transforms it into a common technology independent internal format.\nIn the normalization step the license information is completed and unified.\nInformation not contained in the raw data is added.\nWhere possible the applicable licenses are expressed by SPDX-IDs.\nMany open source compontents are available via multi licensing models.\nWithin qualification the finally applicable licenses are selected.\nIn the legal assessment the compliance of applicable licenses will be checked based on generic rules defined in company wide policies and possibly project specific project specific extensions.\nDefining those rules is considered as &quot;legal advice&quot; and possibly needs to be done by lawyers which are authorized to do so.\nFor this step Solicitor only provides a framework / tool to support the process here but does not deliver any predefined rules.\nThe final export step produces documents based on the internal data model. This might be the list of licenses to be forwarded to the customer or a license compliance report. Data might also be fed into other systems.\nA more technical oriented view of Solicitor is given below.\nThere are three major technical components: The reader and writer components are performing import and export of data. The business logic - doing normalization, qualification and legal assessment is done by a rule engine. Rules are mainly defined via decision tables. Solicitor comes with a starting set of rules for normalization and qualification but these rulesets need to be extended within the projects.

Introduction\nTodays software projects often make use of large amounts of Open Source software. Being\ncompliant with the license obligations of the used software components is a prerequisite for every such project. This results in different requirements that the project might need to fulfill. Those requirements can be grouped into two main categories:\nThings that need to be done to actually fulfill license obligations\nThings that need to be done to monitor / report fulfillment of license obligations\nMost of the above activities share common points:\nThe need to have an inventory of used (open source) components and their licenses\nSome rule based evaluation and reporting based on this inventory\nIn practice these easy looking tasks might get complex due to various aspects:\nThe number of open source components might be quite large (&gt;&gt; 100 for a typical webapplication based on state of the art programming frameworks)\nAgile development and rapid changes of used components result in frequent changes of the inventory\nOpen Source usage scenarios and license obligations might be OK in one context (e.g. in the relation between a software developer and his client) but might be completely inacceptable in another context (e.g. when the client distributes the same software to end customers)\nLegal interpretation of license conditions often differ from organisation to organisation and result in different compliance rules to be respected.\nLicense information for components is often not available in a standardized form which would allow automatic processing\nTools for supporting the license management processes are often specific to a technology or build tool and do not support all aspects of OSS license management.\nOf course there are specific commercial tool suites which address the IP rights and license domain. But due to high complexity and license costs those tools are out of reach for most projects - at least for permanent use.\nSolicitor tries to address some of the issues hightlighted above. In its initial version it is a tool for programmatically executing a process which was originally defined as an Excel-supported manual process.\nWhen running Solicitor three subsequent processing steps are executed:\nCreating an initial component and license inventory based on technology specific input files\nRule based normalization and evaluation of licenses\nGeneration of output documents\nWarning\nSolicitor comes with a set of sample rules for the normalization and evaluation of licenses.\nEven though these included rules are not &quot;intentionally wrong&quot; they are only samples and you should never rely on these builtin rules without checking and possibly modifying their content and consulting your lawyer.\nSolicitor is a tool for technically supporting the management of OSS licenses within your project.\nSolicitor neither gives legal advice nor is a replacement for a lawyer.\n"},{"id":1142,"path":"../..\\..\\..\\..\\..\\xampp\\htdocs\\devonfw.github.io\\website\\pages\\docs/master-solicitor.asciidoc_introduction.html#master-solicitor.asciidoc_licensing-of-solicitor","type":"docs","title":"Licensing of Solicitor","body":"97.1.

The following points are important here:\nRule templates:\nRule templates should be regarded as part of the Solicitor implementation and should not be changed on an engagement level.\nExcel decision table data\nThe Excel tables might be extended or changed on a per project level.\nThe rules defined by the tabular data will have decreasing &quot;salience&quot; (priority) from top to bottom\nIn general multiple rules defined within a table might fire for the same data to be processed; the definition of the rules within the rule template will normally ensure that once a rule from the decision table was processed no other rule from that table will be processed for the same data\nThe excel tables contain header information in the first row which is only there for documentation purposes; the first row is completely ignored when creating rules from the xls\nThe rows starting from the second row contain decision table data\nThe first &quot;empty&quot; row (which does not contain data in any of the defined columns) ends the decision table\nDecision tables might use multiple condition columns which define the data that a rule matches. Often such conditions are optional: If left free in the Excel table the condition will be omitted from the rule conditions. This allows to define very specific rules (which only fire on exact data patterns) or quite general rules which get activated on large groups of data. Defining general rules further down in the table (with lower salience/priority) ensures that more specific rules get fired earlier. This even allows to define a default rule at the end of the table which gets fired if no other rule could be applied.\nrule groups: Business rules are executed within groups. All rules resulting from a single decision table are assigned to the same rule group. The order of execution of the rule groups\nis defined by the sequence of declaration in the config file. Processing of the current group will\nbe finished when there are no more rules to fire in that group. Processing of the next group will then start.

For those fields the following syntax applies:\nIf the given value of the XLS field starts with the prefix NOT: then the outcome of the remaining condition is logically negated, i.e. this field condition is true if the rest of the condition is NOT fulfilled.\nA prefix of REGEX: indicates that the remainder of the field defines a Java Regular Expression.

Collecting all source code can be accomplished by another Maven plugin: Apache Maven Dependency Plugin.\nIt downloads all OSS Source Jars into the folder: \\target\\sources across the parent and all child maven projects.\nYou configure the plugin like this:\n&lt;plugin&gt;\n&lt;groupId&gt;org.apache.maven.plugins&lt;/groupId&gt;\n&lt;artifactId&gt;maven-dependency-plugin&lt;/artifactId&gt;\n&lt;version&gt;3.0.2&lt;/version&gt;\n&lt;configuration&gt;\n&lt;classifier&gt;sources&lt;/classifier&gt;\n&lt;failOnMissingClassifierArtifact&gt;false&lt;/failOnMissingClassifierArtifact&gt;\n&lt;outputDirectory&gt;${project.build.directory}/sources&lt;/outputDirectory&gt;\n&lt;/configuration&gt;\n&lt;executions&gt;\n&lt;execution&gt;\n&lt;id&gt;src-dependencies&lt;/id&gt;\n&lt;phase&gt;package&lt;/phase&gt;\n&lt;goals&gt;\n&lt;!-- use unpack-dependencies instead if you want to explode the sources --&gt;\n&lt;goal&gt;copy-dependencies&lt;/goal&gt;\n&lt;/goals&gt;\n&lt;/execution&gt;\n&lt;/executions&gt;\n&lt;/plugin&gt;\nYou run the plugin from command line like this:\n$ mvn dependency:copy-dependencies -Dclassifier=sources\nThe plugin provides another goal that also unzips the jars, which is not recommended, since contents get mixed up.\nDeliver the OSS source jars to your client with the release of your custom solution. This has been done physically - e.g. on DVD.\n"},{"id":1200,"path":"../..\\..\\..\\..\\..\\xampp\\htdocs\\devonfw.github.io\\website\\pages\\docs/oss-compliance.asciidoc.html#oss-compliance.asciidoc_handle-oss-within-ci-process","type":"docs","title":"Handle OSS within CI-process","body":"108.9.

Cobigen code-generator UI code generation and more\nThe Cobigen incremental code generator which is part of devonfw has been significantly improved. Based on a single data schema it can generate the JPA/Hibernate code for the whole service layer (from data-access code to web services) for all CRUD operations. When generating code, Cobigen is able to detect and leave untouched any code which developers have added manually.\nIn the new release it supports Spring Data for data access and it is now capable of generating the whole User Interface as well: data-grids and individual rows/records with support for filters, pagination etc. That is to say: Cobigen can now generate automatically all the code from the server-side database access layer all the way up to the UI &quot;screens&quot; in the web browser.\nCurrently we support Sencha Ext JS with support for Angular 2 coming soon. The code generated by Cobigen can be opened and used by Sencha Architect, the visual design tool, which enables the programmer to extend and enhance the generated UI non-programmatically. When Cobigen regenerates the code, even those additions are left intact. All these features combined allow for an iterative, incremental way of development which can be up to an order of an magnitude more productive than &quot;programming manual&quot;\nCobigen can now also be used for code-generation within the context of an engagement. It is easily extensible and the process of how to extend it for your own project is well documented. This becomes already worthwhile (&quot;delivers ROI&quot;) when having 5+ identical elements within the project.\nFor more information see: The Cobigen documentation and the corresponding changer in the devonfw Guide and\n"},{"id":1217,"path":"../..\\..\\..\\..\\..\\xampp\\htdocs\\devonfw.github.io\\website\\pages\\docs/release-notes-version-2.1.asciidoc.html#release-notes-version-2.1.asciidoc_angular-2","type":"releasenote","title":"Angular 2","body":"119.3.3.

That is to say: we should work on improving existing features rather than adding new ones and strengthen the qualitative aspects of the software development life cycle, i.e. testing, infrastructure (CI, provisioning) etc.\n&#x201C;Dash&#x201D; already is very much an example of this.

Further more, a more modularized approach has been followed in the current release of My Thai star application to decouple client from implementation details. Which provides better encapsulation of code and dependency management for API and implementation classes. This has been achieved with creation of a new &#x201C;API&#x201D; module that contain interfaces for REST services and corresponding Request/Response objects. With existing &#x201C;Core&#x201D; module being dependent on &#x201C;API&#x201D; module.

Introduction\nWe are proud to announce the immediate release of devonfw version 2.4 (code named &#x201C;EVE&#x201D; during development). This version is the first one that fully embraces Open Source, including components like the documentation assets and CobiGen. Most of the IP (Intellectual Property or proprietary) part of devonfw are now published under the Apache License version 2.0 (with the documentation under the Creative Commons License (Attribution-NoDerivatives)). This includes the GitHub repositories where all the code and documentation is located. All of these repositories are now open for public viewing as well.\n&#x201C;EVE&#x201D; contains a slew of new features but in essence it is already driven by what we expect to be the core focus of 2018: strengthening the platform and improving quality.\nThis release is also fully focused on deepening the platform rather than expanding it. That is to say: we have worked on improving existing features rather than adding new ones and strengthen the qualitative aspects of the software development life cycle, i.e. security, testing, infrastructure (CI, provisioning) etc.\n&#x201C;EVE&#x201D; already is very much an example of this. This release contains the Allure Test Framework (included as an incubator in version 2.3) update called MrChecker Test Framework. MrChecker is an automated testing framework for functional testing of web applications, API web services, Service Virtualization, Security and in coming future native mobile apps, and databases. All modules have tangible examples of how to build resilient integration test cases based on delivered functions.\nAnother incubator being updated is the devonfw Shop Floor which intended to be a compilation of DevOps experiences from the devonfw perspective. A new part of the release is the new Solution Guide for Application Security based on the state of the art in OWASP based application security.\nThere is a whole range of new features and improvements which can be seen in that light. OASP4j 2.6 changes and improves the package structure of the core Java framework. The My Thai Star sample app has now been upgraded to Angular 6, lots of bugs have been fixed and the devonfw Guide has once again been improved.\nLast but not least, this release contains the formal publication of the devonfw Methodology or The Accelerated Solution Design - an Industry Standards based solution design and specification (documentation) methodology for Agile (and less-than-agile) projects.\n"},{"id":1274,"path":"../..\\..\\..\\..\\..\\xampp\\htdocs\\devonfw.github.io\\website\\pages\\docs/release-notes-version-2.4.asciidoc.html#release-notes-version-2.4.asciidoc_changes-and-new-features","type":"releasenote","title":"Changes and new features","body":"116.2.

The ASD is carefully designed to be a practical guideline that fosters and ensures the collaboration and communication among all team members.\nThe Accelerated Solution Design is:\nA practical guideline rather than a &#x201C;methodology&#x201D;\nBased on industry standards rather than proprietary methods\nConsisting of an evolving, &#x201C;living&#x201D;, document set rather than a static, fixed document\nEncapsulating the business requirements, functional definitions as well as Architecture design\nBased on the intersection of Lean, Agile, DDD and User Story Mapping\nAnd further it is based on the essential belief or paradigm that ASD should be:\nFocused on the design (definition) of the &#x201C;externally observable behavior of a system&#x201D;\nPromoting communication and collaboration between team members\nGuided by prototypes\nFor more on the devonfw Methodology / ASD, see:\nhttps://github.com/devonfw/devon-methodology/blob/master/design-guidelines/Accelerated_Solution_Design.adoc\n&#x2190;&#xA0;Previous:&#xA0;devonfw Release notes 3.0 &#x201C;Fry&#x201D;&#xA0;| &#x2191;&#xA0;Up:&#xA0;Release Notes&#xA0;| &#x2302;&#xA0;Home:&#xA0;devonfw guide&#xA0;| Next:&#xA0;devonfw Release notes 2.3 &quot;Dash&quot;&#xA0;&#x2192;\n"},{"id":1288,"path":"../..\\..\\..\\..\\..\\xampp\\htdocs\\devonfw.github.io\\website\\pages\\docs/release-notes-version-2020.04.asciidoc.html#release-notes-version-2020.04.asciidoc","type":"releasenote","title":"devonfw Release notes 2020.04","body":"112. devonfw Release notes 2020.04\n"},{"id":1289,"path":"../..\\..\\..\\..\\..\\xampp\\htdocs\\devonfw.github.io\\website\\pages\\docs/release-notes-version-2020.04.asciidoc.html#release-notes-version-2020.04.asciidoc_introduction","type":"releasenote","title":"Introduction","body":"112.1.

Introduction\nWe are proud to announce the immediate release of devonfw version 3.0 (code named &#x201C;Fry&#x201D; during development). This version is the consolidation of Open Source, focused on the major namespace change ever in the platform, removing the OASP references and adopting the new devonfw names for each technical stack or framework.\nThe new stack names are the following:\ndevon4j, former OASP4J, is the new name for Java.\ndevon4ng, former OASP4JS, is the new one for Angular.\ndevon4net, is the new .NET stack.\ndevon4X, is the new stack for Xamarin development.\ndevon4node, is the new devonfw incubator for node.js.\nThe new devon4j version was created directly from the latest oasp4j version (3.0.0). Hence it brings all the features and values that oasp4j offered. However, the namespace migration was used to do some housekeeping and remove deprecated code as well as reduce dependencies. Therefore your data-access layer will no longer have to depend on any third party except for devon4j as well as of course the JPA. We also have improved the application template that now comes with a modern JSON logging ready for docker and logstash based environments.\nTo help you upgrading we introduced a migration feature in devcon. This can automatically migrate your code from oasp4j (even older versions starting from 2.4.0) to the latest version of devon4j. There might be some small manual changes left to do but 90% of the migration will be done automatically for you.\nBesides, the first version of the devonfw plugin for SonarQube has been released. It extends SonarQube with the ability to validate your code according to the devon4j architecture. More details at https://github.com/devonfw/sonar-devon-plugin.\nThis is the first release that integrates the new devonfw .NET framework, called devon4net, and Xamarin for mobile native development, devon4X. devon4NET and devon4X are the Capgemini standard frameworks for .NET and Xamarin software development. With the two new family members devonfw provides guidance and acceleration for the major software development platforms in our industry. Their interoperability provides you the assurance your multichannel solution will be consistent across web and mobile channels.\n&#x201C;Fry&#x201D; release contains lots of improvements in our Mr.Checker E2E Testing Framework, including a complete E2E sample inside our reference application My Thai Star. Besides Mr.Checker, we include as an incubator Testar, a test tool (and framework) to test applications at the GUI level whose objective is to solve part of the maintenance problem affecting tests by automatically generating test cases based on a structure that is automatically derived from the GUI. Testar is not included to replace Mr.Checker but rather to provide development teams with a series of interesting options which go beyond what Mr.Checker already provides.\nApart from Mr.Checker, engagements can now use Testar as an extra option for testing. This is a tool that enables the automated system testing of desktop, web and mobile applications at the GUI level. Testar has been added as an incubator to the platform awaiting further development during 2019.\nThe new incubator for node.js, called devon4node, has been included and implemented in several internal projects. This incubator is based on the Nest framework https://www.nestjs.com/. Nest is a framework for building efficient, scalable Node.js server-side applications. It uses progressive JavaScript, is built with TypeScript (preserves compatibility with pure JavaScript) and combines elements of OOP (Object Oriented Programming), FP (Functional Programming), and FRP (Functional Reactive Programming). Under the hood, Nest makes use of Express, but also provides compatibility with a wide range of other libraries (e.g. Fastify). This allows for easy use of the myriad third-party plugins which are available.\nIn order to facilitate the utilization of Microsoft Visual Studio Code in devonfw, we have developed and included the new devonfw Platform Extension Pack with lots of features to develop and test applications with this IDE in languages and frameworks such as TypeScript, JavaScript, .NET, Java, Rust, C++ and many more. More information at https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=devonfw.devonfw-extension-pack. Also, you can contribute to this extension in this GitHub repository https://github.com/devonfw/devonfw-extension-pack-vscode.\nThere is a whole range of new features and improvements which can be seen in that light. The My Thai Star sample app has now been upgraded to devon4j and devon4ng, a new devon4node backend implementation has been included that is seamless interchangeable, an E2E MrChecker sample project, CICD and deployment scripts and lots of bugs have been fixed.\nLast but not least, the projects wikis and the devonfw Guide has once again been updated accordingly before the big refactor that will be addressed in the following release in 2019.\n"},{"id":1364,"path":"../..\\..\\..\\..\\..\\xampp\\htdocs\\devonfw.github.io\\website\\pages\\docs/release-notes-version-3.0.asciidoc.html#release-notes-version-3.0.asciidoc_changes-and-new-features","type":"releasenote","title":"Changes and new features","body":"115.2.

The tests are random and are generated and executed automatically.\nIf you need to do directed tests you can create scripts to test specific requirements of your application.\nTestar is included in the devonfw distro or can be downloaded from https://testar.org/download/.\nThe Github repository can be found at o: https://github.com/TESTARtool/TESTAR.\n&#x2190;&#xA0;Previous:&#xA0;devonfw Release notes 3.1 &#x201C;Goku&#x201D;&#xA0;| &#x2191;&#xA0;Up:&#xA0;Release Notes&#xA0;| &#x2302;&#xA0;Home:&#xA0;devonfw guide&#xA0;| Next:&#xA0;devonfw Release notes 2.4 &#x201C;EVE&#x201D;&#xA0;&#x2192;\n"},{"id":1377,"path":"../..\\..\\..\\..\\..\\xampp\\htdocs\\devonfw.github.io\\website\\pages\\docs/release-notes-version-3.1.asciidoc.html#release-notes-version-3.1.asciidoc","type":"releasenote","title":"devonfw Release notes 3.1 &#x201C;Goku&#x201D;","body":"114. devonfw Release notes 3.1 &#x201C;Goku&#x201D;\n"},{"id":1378,"path":"../..\\..\\..\\..\\..\\xampp\\htdocs\\devonfw.github.io\\website\\pages\\docs/release-notes-version-3.1.asciidoc.html#release-notes-version-3.1.asciidoc_introduction","type":"releasenote","title":"Introduction","body":"114.1. Introduction\nWe are proud to announce the immediate release of devonfw version 3.1 (code named &#x201C;Goku&#x201D; during development). This version is the first one that implements our new documentation workflow, that will allow users to get the updated documentation at any moment and not to wait for the next devonfw release.\nThis is now possible as we have established a new workflow and rules during development of our assets. The idea behind this is that all the repositories contain a documentation folder and, in any pull request, the developer must include the related documentation change. A new Travis CI configuration added to all these repositories will automatically take the changes and publish them in the wiki section of every repository and in the new devonfw-guide repository that consolidates all the changes from all the repositories. Another pipeline will take changes from this consolidated repository and generate dynamically the devonfw guide in PDF and in the next weeks in HTML for the new planned devonfw website. The following schema explains this process:\nThis release includes the very first version of the new CobiGen CLI. Now using commands, you will be able to generate code the same way as you do with Eclipse. This means that you can use CobiGen on other IDEs like Visual Studio Code or IntelliJ. Please take a look at https://github.com/devonfw/cobigen/wiki/howto_Cobigen-CLI-generation for more info.\nThe devonfw-shop-floor project has got a lot of updates in order to make even easier the creation of devonfw projects with CICD pipelines that run on the Production Line, deploy on Red Hat OpenShift Clusters and in general Docker environments. See the details below.\nThis release includes the very first version of our devonfw-ide tool that will allow users to automate devonfw setup and update the development environment. This tool will become the default devonfw setup tool in future releases. For more information please visit the repository https://github.com/devonfw/devon-ide.\nFollowing the same collaboration model we used in order to improve the integration of devonfw with Red Hat OpenShift and which allowed us to get the Red Hat Open Shift Primed certification, we have been working alongside with SAP HANA developers in order to support this database in the devon4j. This model was based on the contribution and review of pull requests in our reference application My Thai Star. In this case, SAP developers collaborated with us in the following two new use cases:\nPrediction of future demand\nGeospatial analysis and clustering of customers\nMore info at https://blogs.sap.com/2019/06/17/introducing-devonfw-support-for-sap-hana/.\nLast but not least the devonfw extension pack for VS Code has been improved with the latest extensions and helpers for this IDE. Among many others you can now use:\nRemote development on Docker containers and VMs https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.vscode-remote-extensionpack\nDependency Analysis for maven and npm https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=redhat.fabric8-analytics\nReact Native Tools https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=msjsdiag.vscode-react-native\nNgRx Snippets https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/itemdetails?itemName=hardikpthv.NgRxSnippets\nAlso it is worth the try of the updated support for Java and Spring Boot development in VS Code.

Introduction\nWe are proud to announce the immediate release of devonfw version 3.2 (code named &#x201C;Homer&#x201D; during development). This version is the first one that contains the new devonfw IDE by default, so there is no need to download a huge ZIP with the whole distribution regardless of the use to which it will be put. The new devonfw IDE CLI will allow any user to setup a customized development environment completely configured with access to all the devonfw features, frameworks and tools. As we access to the official IDEs this is also the first version macOS compatible.\nThis release consolidates the documentation workflow adding the contents dynamically to the new devonfw website at the same time the PDF is generated. This have been achieved using a new GitHub action that takes the contents and builds the HTML files for the documentation section of the website. The documentation workflow proposed in the following picture is now complete:\nThis release also includes the first version of devon4node. We consider that node.js should be a first-class citizen inside the devonfw platform and for that reason we have included the latest development technologies for this ecosystem. The devon4node CLI, schematics and other tools will allow our users to create powerful node.js applications with the same philosophy you may find in the other languages and frameworks included. More information at its section below.\nThe new devon4net 3.2.0 version is also included in this release. Based on the .NET Core 3.0 and containing lots of new features gathered from important and recent projects, it represents a great improvement and an intermediate step to provide support for the incoming .NET Core 3.1 LTS. More information at its section below.\nThis release includes the final version of the new CobiGen CLI and completely integrated with the new devonfw IDE. Now using commands, you will be able to generate code the same way as you do with Eclipse. This means that you can use CobiGen on other IDEs like Visual Studio Code or IntelliJ. Besides the Update command has been implemented. Now you will be able to update easily all your CobiGen plug-ins and templates inside the CLI.\nOn the other hand, the refactoring process has been completely developed, improving the mergers and including input readers for any other languages and frameworks, allowing the creation of models to generate code from them. Last, but not least, this new version includes the new templates for devon4net, devon4ng and devon4j generation.\nAnd as always, My Thai Star has been updated to the latest versions of devon4j, devon4node and devon4net including completely State Management with NgRx in its devon4ng implementation upgrade.\nThis is the last release with the current semantic versioning number and without a fixed release calendar. From now on the new devonfw releases will happen in April, August and December and will be named YYYY.MM.NN, being the first release of the next year the 2020.04.00.\n"},{"id":1394,"path":"../..\\..\\..\\..\\..\\xampp\\htdocs\\devonfw.github.io\\website\\pages\\docs/release-notes-version-3.2.asciidoc.html#release-notes-version-3.2.asciidoc_changes-and-new-features","type":"releasenote","title":"Changes and new features","body":"113.2.

This new solution is provided as a small *.tar.gz file that is publicly available. It works on all platforms and has been tested on Windows, MacOS, and Linux. After extraction you only need to run a setup script. Here you provide a settings git URL for your customer project or simply hit return for testing or small projects. After reading and confirming the terms of use it will download all required tools in the proper versions for your operating system and configure them. Instead of various confusing scripts there is now only one CLI command devon for all use-cases what gives a much better user experience.\nTo get started go to the home page.
